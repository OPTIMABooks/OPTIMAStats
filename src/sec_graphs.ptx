Introduction
Once we have collected our data, we need to be able to understand it. Data in
its raw form--a long
list of values--is not very informative. In this section we will explore ways
in which we can organize
data in tables and describe the values using graphs.
The graph we choose to use will depend on the data we are describing as well as
other factors.
Some of these factors are:
Does our data come from a quantitative variable or a qualitative variable?
Is our data univariate or bivariate?
Do we want a "quick-and-dirty" graph we can sketch by hand, or will a computer
be drawing
the graph for us (see lab activity one for computer related information)?
Does the data represent the value of a variable over time, or the value of a
variable from
many different subjects?
By answering these questions we will learn to choose and construct an
appropriate graph to
describe many different data sets. We will also learn to interpret these graphs
as a preliminary step
in analyzing our data.

Qualitative Data - Tables
Recall that a qualitative variable produces data that represents categories,
and not numerical
values. Consider the following example.
Example 1.2.1
To better understand their customers, a pizza parlor decides to collect a list
of favorite pizza
toppings. They choose an appropriate sampling technique and gather the
following data from 96
customers. What does this data tell you?

Solution
Without some organization, it is hard to glean anything from this data. We need
a way to simplify
things!
Our first step in constructing a graph for this data is to summarize. With any
qualitative variable, we
can construct what is called a frequency table to summarize the values in our
data set.
Frequency Table
A frequency table is a two column table used to summarize the values of a
qualitative variable.
The first column contains the various categories that the variable can take on.
The second
column contains the counts or frequency with which each category appears.
To see how this works, let's use a frequency table to summarize the pizza
topping data set we saw
in our example.
Example 1.2.2
Construct a frequency table for the pizza topping data seen in example 1.2.1.
Does this table
give you a better picture of the data set?
Solution
Steps:
1. List all of the possible pizza toppings in
the first column of our table.
2. Count the frequency with which each
topping appears.
3. Check to ensure that the total of our
counts adds up to the total number of
values in the set of data.
This definitely gives us a clearer picture of the
data set. We can now see the number of times
each topping was selected as somebody's
favorite.
Topping

Anchovies

Bacon

Cheese

Green Peppers
11
Mushrooms
4
Olives
15
Onions
5
Pepperoni
17
Pineapple
6
Sausage
10
Total:
96
While this is a great way to summarize data, it can still be hard to tell how
popular categories are in
relation to one another. In the previous example, there is a difference of two
between the number
of customers who favor cheese and the number who favor olives. Is that a large
difference? To
better analyze this, we can change from using counts to using percents.
Relative Frequency Table
A relative frequency table is a table in which each category is listed together
with the ratio of
the total values from the data set that fall into that category.
Let's revisit the pizza topping example once again.
Example 1.2.3
Construct a relative frequency table for the pizza topping data seen in
examples 1.2.1 and 1.2.2.
Solution
Steps:
1. Start with the frequency table from the
previous example.
2. Divide each category frequency by the
grand total (in this case 96).
3. Check to ensure that the sum is 1. Note
that in this case, the extra 0.0002 is a
result of rounding error in our four-
decimal-place answers.
With this relative frequency table, we can more
easily tell how each category relates to the
others.
Topping
Relative Frequency
Anchovies
1/96 = 0.0104
Bacon
10/96 = 0.1042
Cheese
17/96 = 0.1771
Green Peppers
11/96 = 0.1146
Mushrooms
4/96 = 0.0417
Olives
15/96 = 0.1563
Onions
5/96 = 0.0521
Pepperoni
17/96 = 0.1771
Pineapple
6/96 = 0.0625
Sausage
10/96 = 0.1042
Total:
1.0002
While these tables are a good step in better displaying our data, we still need
to translate this into a
picture. To see how we do that, click continue.
Qualitative Data - Graphs
One of the most basic ways to graphically represent data collected for a
qualitative variable is
using a bar graph.
Bar Graph
A bar graph is a graph for qualitative data in which each possible category is
represented by a
bar, the height of which corresponds to the frequency of that category in the
data set. These bars
can be arranged in any order and are separated from each other by empty space.
Note that the first step in creating a bar chart from raw data is to construct
a frequency table. Once
that is done, a computer spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice or Microsoft
Excel is a great
way to quickly construct bar graphs. Consider the following example, based on
our pizza topping
example from the last page.
Example 1.2.4
Construct a bar graph for the pizza topping data seen in example 1.2.2.
Solution
Recall that the frequency table for this data is:
Topping

Anchovies
1
Bacon

Cheese
17
Green Peppers
11
Mushrooms
4
Olives
14
Onions
6
Pepperoni

Pineapple
Sausage

10
Graphing this produces:
What happens to the bar graph if we use the relative frequency table instead of
the frequency
table? We do get a new type of graph, but as we shall see, the shape of the
graph will not change,
just the scale. First, the definition.
Relative Frequency Bar Graph
A relative frequency bar graph is a graph for qualitative data in which each
category is
represented by a bar, the height of which corresponds to the percent of the
data values that are
in that category. These bars can be arranged in any order and are separated
from each other by
empty space.
Below we construct a relative frequency bar graph for the pizza topping
example.
Example 1.2.5
Construct a bar graph for the pizza topping data seen in example 1.2.3.
Solution
Recall that the relative frequency table for this
data is:
Topping
Percent
Anchovies
1.04
Bacon
10.42
Cheese
17.71
Green Peppers
11.46
Mushrooms
4.17
Olives
15.63
Onions
5.21
Pepperoni
17.71
Pineapple
6.25
Sausage
Graphing this produces:
10.42
Both the bar graph and relative frequency bar graph are particularly useful for
comparing the
number or percent of values that are in one category with the number or
proportion in another
category. However it is sometimes better to show how each category frequency or
proportion
relates to the whole. For this type of situation, a pie graph is more useful.
Pie Graph
A pie graph is a graph for qualitative data in which a circle is divided into
sectors or wedges
representing the various categories. The area of these sectors is determined by
the relative
frequency of the associated category.
With the same spreadsheet program we used to build our bar graphs, we can also
construct pie
graphs. To see how this works, we will revisit example 1.2.2 one last time.
Example 1.2.6
Construct a pie graph for the pizza topping data seen in example 1.2.3.
Solution
Recall that the relative frequency table for this
data is:
Topping

Graphing this produces:

There is one more situation involving qualitative variables which we must
investigate.
Click continue to see what to do with bivariate qualitative data.
Qualitative Data - Bivariate Data
The frequency tables and graphs that we've looked at so far work well for
univariate data. But they
need to be modified before they will work with data involving more than one
variable. Multivariate
data can be very difficult to summarize and display graphically. Because of
this, we usually just
look at each variable separately. However when we have two variables there are
some special
techniques that we can use to summarize and display the data.
Contingency Table
A contingency table, also called a two-way table, is a table used to summarize
bivariate
qualitative data. The columns in this table represent the various categories of
one of the two
variables, and the rows represent the categories of the other variable. In each
cell (row-column
combination) we record the number of subjects with that row category and column
category.
To see how a contingency table can be read, let's look at an example involving
college students
and summer vacation plans.
Example 1.2.7
Four hundred randomly selected college students are asked to give their class
standing
(Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, or Senior) and their summer plans (work, play, or
study). The
following contingency table summarizes the results of this survey. Determine
the number of
Freshmen who are not working this summer.
Freshman
Sophomore
Junior
Senior

35
30
51
Play
49
62
29
17
Study
28
17
46
13
Solution
The column labeled "Freshmen" has three rows corresponding to work, play, and
study. To get
the number of Freshmen who are not working we add together those who are
playing and those
who are studying to get 49+28 = 77.
When we create a contingency table, or if we are just given a contingency
table, we sometimes will
want to look at each variable separately. In the example above, we may want to
know how many of
these students intend to work this summer. To answer this question, we need to
total up the rows
and/or columns. These totals are typically displayed in the margins of the
table, leading to the
following definition.
Marginal Distribution
A marginal distribution of a contingency table is either the sums of the rows
of that contingency
table, or the sum of the columns of that contingency table.
Let's find the marginal distributions for the student summer plans example
above.
Example 1.2.8
Construct the marginal distributions for the contingency table seen in example
1.2.7. Use these
distributions to determine (a) the number of students who plan to work this
summer, and (b) the
number of Juniors who took part in the study.
Solution
In order to find these marginal distributions, we
first add together the rows and columns from
the table in example 1.2.7.
Once that is done, we can answer these
questions by reading off the appropriate
numbers.
1.
139 students plan to work this summer
2.
105 Juniors participated in the study.

note: the sum of the row totals and column totals should both be the grand
total, 400 in this case.
A contingency table is a great tool for summarizing bivariate qualitative data.
But in order to
describe this data with a graph, we will need to make a modification to our bar
graph. We will use a
special type of bar graph called a stacked bar graph.
Stacked Bar Graph
A stacked bar graph is used to display the data in a contingency table. One of
the two variables
is chosen as the primary variable, and a bar is created for each category of
the primary variable.
The height of the bar is equal to the marginal distribution entry for that
category. The bar is
broken up into "stacked" pieces, the heights of which represent the frequency
secondary variable
categories in that primary variable category.
This definition can be difficult to decipher. Let's look at stacked bar graphs
for the summer plans
data. Again, these graphs were created using a spreadsheet program.
Example 1.2.9
Create two stacked bar graphs for the contingency table seen in example 1.2.7--
one graph with
class standing as the primary variable, and the other with summer plans as the
primary variable.
Solution
First we create a graph with class standing as the primary variable.
And then the graph with summer plans as the primary variable.

Quantitative Data - Tables
When we wish to summarize quantitative variables, we run into many of the same
problems that
we had with qualitative variables. The raw data itself is usually not very
useful. Our first task is to
come up with a way to summarize this data in a table, like we did with
frequency tables for
qualitative variables. To do this, we must create "categories" to use as the
rows for our table.
Frequency Distribution
In order to summarize values from a quantitative variable, we must first break
the range of
values up into "categories" as follows.
Class - the range of values taken on by the variable is broken up into sections
called
classes.
Upper Class Limit - the largest number that belongs to a class is called the
upper class
limit.
Class Width - the difference between the upper class limit of a given class and
the upper
class limit of the previous class (or the minimum value in the data set for the
first class) is
called the class width. This value should almost always be the same for each
class.
Once the classes have been established, we treat them as categories and count
the number of
values that fall into each class. The resulting table is called a frequency
distribution
.
Note that although a frequency distribution will look very similar to a
frequency table, there is a
difference. Namely, we must break the range of values up into classes in order
to construct our
table. It is probably easiest to remember that a frequency table is used to
summarize data from a
qualitative variable, and a frequency distribution is used to summarize data
from a quantitative
variable.
Example 1.2.10
The height of tomato plants is of particular interest to Daisy. She spends her
summer gathering
data on the heights of tomato plants in various randomly selected gardens in
her home town.
Summarize the data she collected below, showing these heights rounded to the

Solution
To construct our frequency distribution, we follow these
steps:
1. Determine the class width as follows:
a. Find the range: 8.1 to 17.9. Lets round to
8.0 to 18, giving a range of 10.
b. Find the class width by taking range/#
classes, or 10/5 = 2.
2. Starting with our minimum value (we rounded to
8), add the class width to get the upper class limits
(10, 12, 14, 16, 18).
3. List the classes in the first column of our table.
Note that these should not include the previous
class upper class limit, thus the second class is
from 10.1-12, not 10-12.
4. Finally, count the number of values that fall into
each class. For example, there are 7 values
bigger than 10, but less than or equal to 12.

Once we have summarized our data in a frequency distribution, we can of course
create a relative
frequency distribution by dividing each class frequency by the grand total. We
can also create a
representative graph. To see how that is done, click continue.
Quantitative Data - Histograms
The graph that we use to describe data summarized by a frequency distribution
is very similar to
the bar graphs we used to summarize data in a frequency table. There is,
however, an important
distinction.
Histogram
A histogram is a graph for quantitative data in which each class in a frequency
distribution for
that data is represented by a bar, the height of which corresponds to the
frequency of that class.
These bars must be arranged in ascending order of the classes and must touch
each other.
Note that in a histogram, the order is important because the classes of a
frequency distribution are
themselves ordered from smallest values to largest values. Also, note that the
bars touch to show
that the classes are contiguous--that is, there is no space between the
classes. Let's try
constructing a histogram for the tomato plant heights seen on the previous
page. We use a
spreadsheet to accomplish this, in much the same way that we constructed a bar
graph.
Example 1.2.11
Construct a histogram for the frequency distribution found in example 1.2.10.
Solution
Recall that the frequency distribution was:
Classes
Frequency
8.1-10
17
10.1-12
7
12.1-14
14
14.1-16
10
16.1-18
16
note: notice that the bars in this graph touch each other, and that they are in
order from lowest
values (8.1-10) up to highest values (16.1-18). These are both important
characteristics for
histograms!

Quantitative Data - Stem-and-Leaf Plots
One of the disadvantages of summarizing quantitative data with a frequency
distribution and
histogram is that you lose the specific values.
Example 1.2.12
Using the frequency distribution created in example 1.2.10, determine how many
tomato plants
are exactly 14.2 inches tall.
Classes
Frequency
8.1-10
17
10.1-12
7
12.1-14
14
14.1-16
10
16.1-18
16
Solution
This is not possible. If all we have is the frequency distribution, we can only
tell that there are
10 plants between 14.1 and 16 inches tall. Some of those may be 14.2 inches
tall, but there is no
way of knowing without going back to the raw data.
If we wish to create a pictorial representation of a set of quantitative data
that also shows the raw
data, we need a new type of graph.
Stem-and-Leaf Plot
In a stem-and-leaf plot, data is represented by separating each value into two
parts: the stem
(all but the right-most digit) and leaf (right-most digit). A table is then
constructed with a row for
each stem with that stem in the first column and a list of all leaves which
belong from that stem in
the second column, given in ascending order.
Stem-and-leaf plots are usually created by hand. Because of this, they are most
useful for
relatively small sets of data where we wish to get a quick picture of the shape
of the data. To get
an accurate picture, it is important that each "leaf" take up the same amount
of space. So if you are
typing a stem-and-leaf plot into a computer, use a mono-spaced font such as
courier so that the
ones (1) don't take up less space than the eights (8). Consider the following
example.
Example 1.2.13
The following is a list of number of quarter credits taken by 30 different
college students.
Construct a stem-and-leaf plot for this data.

Solution
We construct our stem-and-leaf plot as follows:
1. Divide each value into the stem (10's
digit) and leaf (1's digit) pieces. Note that
this yields stems 0, 1, and 2.
2. List the stems in order in the first column
of our table.
3. For each stem, list the associated leaves
in ascending order.
Stem-and-Leaf Plot

122334455555666666677889

Note that the "shape" we see here is like a histogram tilted on its side.
However, in this particular
instance the middle stem seems to have a disproportionate number of leaves. To
remedy this, we
need to split our stems up into smaller pieces.
Expanded Stem-and-Leaf Plot
An expanded stem-and-leaf plot includes more than one row for each stem. The
leaves are
divided equally between the rows representing the associated stems.
Example 1.2.14
Construct an expanded stem-and-leaf plot for the credits data from example
1.2.13 using two
rows per stem.
Solution
This is done in almost exactly the same way as
our last example. The only difference is that
each stem gets two rows. The leaves are then
split up with 0-4 going in the first row and 5-9 in
the second row for a given stem. The result is
shown to the right.
note: this gives us a clearer picture of how the
credit hour values are distributed!

Quantitative Data - Other Graphs
There are several other graphs that can be useful to help display certain types
of data. One of the
most useful "other" types of graphs is meant to display the value of a single
quantitative variable
measured over time.
Time Series
A time series graph, also called a line chart, lists times along the horizontal
axis, and values
along the vertical axis. Points are placed at the appropriate height for the
value of the variable at
each time. These points are then connected with line segments.
To see how a time series can be used, consider the next example.
Example 1.2.15
The value of a certain stock is recorded every January for five years. The
following data is
recorded. Construct a time series graph for this data.
Year
2005
2006
2007
2008
2009
Value
$42
$47.5
$51
$46.3
$35.2
Solution
Using a spreadsheet program, we can produce the following graph.
We need another type of graph to represent bivariate quantitative variables.
This sort of data
comes in (x,y) pairs where x represents the value of the first variable and y
the value of the
second. In order to describe the relationship between the two variables, we can
plot these pairs on
a graph, creating what's called a scatter plot.
Scatter Plot
In a scatter plot we associate one variable from a set of bivariate data with
the x-axis and the
other with the y-axis. We then plot each pair of values as an (x,y) point on
this coordinate
system.
To see how this works, let's look at an example.
Example 1.2.16
The tail length and weight of a certain breed of mice are measured. Construct a
scatter plot and
comment on the relationship, if any, that this graph shows between the two
variables.
Mouse #1
Mouse #2

Mouse #4

10.4
Weight (oz)
3.3

8.6
6.1

2.6

Solution
Using a spreadsheet, we construct the following scatter plot.
There definitely appears to be a relationship between tail length and weight.
Larger tail lengths
seem to correspond to larger weights. While this is not always the case (mouse
#6 is an
exception) it does appear to be a fairly strong relationship.

Quantitative Data - Interpreting Graphs
The reason that we create graphs in the first place is to help us better
understand a set of data. It
is therefore important that we know how to interpret the graphs that we create.
In this class, we will
spend most of our time working with univariate quantitative variables. We thus
need to be sure that
we know how to interpret histograms. There are three major things to look for
in a histogram.
Center
The center of a histogram is the class that most accurately describes the
typical value in the
data set being described.
Modes
One way to describe the shape of a histogram is based on the number of modes
the histogram
possesses. A mode is a class that contains significantly more data than the
classes immediately
next to it. A histogram can be unimodal (one mode), bimodal (two modes),
multimodal (more
than two modes), or it may have no prominent modes in which case it is called
uniform.
Symmetry
Another way to describe the shape of a histogram is based on its symmetry. A
histogram may be
symmetric (meaning it has the same shape on the left and right of its center),
skewed right
(meaning that the right tail is longer than the left) or skewed left (meaning
that the left tail is
longer than the right).
We can tell a lot about the distribution of values of a single quantitative
variable by describing the
histogram in these terms. Consider the following example.
Example 1.2.17
Classify each of the histograms below by number of modes and symmetry. Also,
locate the
center of each histogram.
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
Solution
a.This histogram has a single mode in the 15.1-20 class. The histogram is
skewed to the
left (that tail is longer) and the center appears to be somewhere between the
10.1-15
class and the 15.1-20 class.
b.Histogram (b) has two modes (bimodal). It is also skewed to the left, and the
center
appears to be again between the 10.1-15 and 15.1-20 classes.
c.This histogram is unimodal and symmetric. The center is in the 10.1-15 class.
d.Histogram (d) does not appear to have any modes--while some of the bars are
taller than
their neighbors, the difference is very small. We will call this histogram
uniform and
symmetric with the center right in the middle class, 10.1-15.
e.This histogram is bimodal and appears to be slightly skewed to the left. The
center
appears to be in the middle class.
f.Our final histogram is multimodal (three modes) and symmetric. The center is
in the
middle class, 10.1-15.
Graph (c) above is an example of a very common histogram shape. This shape is
so common, in
fact, that it has a distinctive name.
Mound-Shaped
A histogram is called mound-shaped if it is unimodal and symmetric, with the
mode in the exact
center of the histogram.

Things to Avoid
There are a few common errors in creating and using graphs that should be
mentioned. The first
such error is commonly caused either by a "helpful" computer program with
poorly chosen default
settings, or by a person who is trying to manipulate the graph to "lie" with
statistics.
Example 1.2.18
The following frequency table gives the number of individuals in a recent study
who said that
they had full health insurance coverage, some health insurance coverage, and no
health
insurance coverage. Next to those numbers are two bar charts representing this
data. Determine
which bar chart is misleading, and explain why it is misleading.
Frequency Table
Status Frequency
No Insurance
102
Some Insurance
95
Full Insurance
82
Using a spreadsheet program, the two histograms above were constructed. Both
histograms
used the data above.
Solution
The first histogram is accurate, but the second is not. Notice that the scale
on the side starts at
80 instead of at 0. This exaggerates the difference between the number of
individuals with full
coverage and those with some or no coverage.
This is one example of a problem caused by a violation of an important
principle in graphing.
Area Principle
The area principle states that the area of any bar or sector in a graph
representing a category in
a frequency table or class in a frequency distribution must be in the same
proportion to the rest
of the graph as the frequency of the category or class is to the rest of the
data in the table.
By changing the starting point of the frequency axis in the second histogram
above, we have
violated the area principle. This makes the "full insurance" bar look much
shorter in relation to the
other two bars than the numbers indicate. Another common error in creating
graphs is to violate
the area principle by creating three dimensional graphs. Consider the
following.
Example 1.2.19
A store manager wishes to know the general age group into which most of his
customers fall. He
does a quick survey and comes up with the following frequency distribution. He
then creates a
pie graph to show the proportion of customers in each age group. Do you think
his pie graph
accurately represents the data from the frequency distribution?
Frequency Distribution
Ages
Frequency
0-20
14
21-40
16
41-60
10
61+
7
Solution
This is not an accurate representation of the store manager's frequency
distribution. Notice that
the 0-20 year old age group looks like it may be the largest group based on the
amount of blue
on the graph. However, the 21-40 year old group is in fact larger. By adding
the 3D effects, the
store manager has violated the area principle.
