	<title>Describing Data Graphically</title>

	<introduction xml:id="sec_graphs_intro">
		<p>Once we have collected our data, we need to be able to understand it. Data in its raw form--a long list of values--is not very informative. In this section we will explore ways in which we can organize data in tables and describe the values using graphs. The graph we choose to use will depend on the data we are describing as well as other factors. Some of these factors are:
			<ul>
				<li><p>Does our data come from a quantitative variable or a qualitative variable?</p></li>
				<li><p>Is our data univariate or bivariate?</p></li>
				<li><p>Do we want a "quick-and-dirty" graph we can sketch by hand, or will a computer be drawing the graph for us?</p></li>
				<li><p>Does the data represent the value of a variable over time, or the value of a variable from many different subjects?</p></li>
			</ul>
			By answering these questions we will learn to choose and construct an appropriate graph to describe many different data sets. We will also learn to interpret these graphs as a preliminary step in analyzing our data.

					<p>Without some organization, it is hard to glean anything from this data. We need a way to simplify things!</p>
				</solution>

		</introduction>

		<subsubsection xml:id="sec_grahs_qualitative_frequency-table">
			<title>Frequency Tables</title>
			<p>Our first step in constructing a graph for this data is to summarize. With any qualitative variable, we can construct what is called a <term>frequency table</term> to summarize the values in our data set.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_frequency-table">
				<idx>frequency table</idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>frequency table</term> is a two column table used to summarize the values of a	qualitative variable.	The first column contains the various categories that the variable can take on.	The second column contains the counts or frequency with which each category appears.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>To see how this works, let&apos;s use a frequency table to summarize the pizza topping data set we saw in our first example.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_graphs_frequency-table">
				<title>A Frequency Table</title>
				<statement>
					<p>Construct a frequency table for the pizza topping data seen in <xref ref="examp_graphs_organizing-data" text="custom">the example above</xref>.  Does this table	give you a better picture of the data set?</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<sidebyside widths="55% 40%" margins="0%" valign="middle">
						<p>Steps:
							<ol>
								<li><p>List all of the possible pizza toppings in the first column of our table.</p></li>
								<li><p>Count the frequency with which each topping appears in <xref ref="examp_graphs_organizing-data_table" text="custom">the original data</xref>.</p></li>
								<li><p>Check to ensure that the total of our counts adds up to the total number of values in the set of data.</p></li>
							</ol>
							This definitely gives us a clearer picture of the data set. We can now see the number of times each topping was selected as somebody&apos;s favorite.

				</solution>
			</example>

			<p>While this is a great way to summarize data, it can still be hard to tell how popular categories are in relation to one another. In the previous example, there is a difference of two between the number of customers who favor cheese and the number who favor olives. Is that a large difference? To better analyze this, we can change from using counts to using percents.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_relative-frequency-table">
				<title>Relative Frequency Table</title>

			<p>Let&apos;s revisit the pizza topping data once again, this time constructing a relative frequency table.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_graphs_relative-frequency-table">

								<li><p>Check to ensure that the sum is 1. Note that in this case, the extra 0.0002 is a result of rounding error in our four-decimal-place answers.</p></li>
							</ol>
							With this relative frequency table, we can more easily tell how each category relates to the others.

			<p>While these tables are a good step in better displaying our data, we still need to translate this into a	picture. To see how we do that, continue on to the next section.</p>
		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection xml:id="sec_graphs_qualitative_graphs">
			<title>Graphs</title>
			<p>One of the most basic ways to graphically represent data collected for a qualitative variable is using a bar graph.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_bar-graph">
				<title>Bar Graph</title>
				<idx>bar graph</idx>
				<idx><h>graphs</h><h>bar graph</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>bar graph</term> is a graph for qualitative data in which each possible category is represented by a bar, the height of which corresponds to the frequency of that category in the	data set. These bars can be arranged in any order and are separated from each other by empty space.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>Note that the first step in creating a bar chart from raw data is to construct a frequency table. Once that is done, a computer spreadsheet program such as OpenOffice or Microsoft Excel is a great	way to quickly construct bar graphs. Consider the following example, based on	our pizza topping dats.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_graphs_bar-graph">
				<title>Constructing a Bar Graph</title>
				<statement>
					<p>Construct a bar graph for the pizza topping data seen in <xref ref="examp_graphs_organizing-data" /></p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>Based on the <xref ref="examp_graphs_frequency-table_table" text="custom">frequency table for this data</xref>, we get the following bar graph.</p>
					<figure xml:id="fig_graphs_examp_bar-graph">

						  </latex-image>
						</image>
					</figure>
				</solution>
			</example>
			<p>What happens to the bar graph if we use the relative frequency table instead of the frequency table? We do get a new type of graph, but as we shall see, the shape of the graph will not change, just the scale. First, the definition.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_relative-frequency-bar-graph">
				<idx>relative frequency bar graph</idx>
				<idx><h>graphs</h><h>relative frequency bar graph</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A relative frequency bar graph is a graph for qualitative data in which each category is represented by a bar, the height of which corresponds to the percent of the	data values that are in that category. These bars can be arranged in any order and are separated from each other by empty space.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>Below we construct a relative frequency bar graph for the pizza topping example.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_graphs_relative-frequency-bar-graph">
				<title>Constructing a Relative Frequency Bar Graph</title>
				<statement>
					<p>Construct a bar graph for the pizza topping data seen in <xref ref="examp_graphs_organizing-data"/>.</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>Based on the <xref ref="examp_graphs_relative-frequency-table_table" text="custom">relative frequency table</xref>, we get the following bar graph.</p>
					<figure xml:id="fig_graphs_examp_relative-frequency-bar-graph">

							</latex-image>
						</image>
					</figure>
					<p>Notice that the bar graph is scaled in terms of percent instead of the relative frequencies from the table.  This is a common quirk with using spreadsheet programs to produce such graphs.</p>
				</solution>
			</example>
			<p>Both the bar graph and relative frequency bar graph are particularly useful for comparing the number or percent of values that are in one category with the number or proportion in another category. However it is sometimes better to show how each category frequency or proportion relates to the whole. For this type of situation, a <term>pie graph</term> is more useful.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_pie-graph">
				<idx>pie graph</idx>
				<idx><h>graphs</h><h>pie graph</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>pie graph</term> is a graph for qualitative data in which a circle is divided into sectors or wedges	representing the various categories. The area of these sectors is determined by	the relative frequency of the associated category.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>With the same spreadsheet program we used to build our bar graphs, we can also construct pie	graphs. To see how this works, we will revisit our pizza topping example one last time.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_graphs_pie-graph">
				<title>Constructing a Pie Graph</title>
				<statement>
					<p>Construct a pie graph for the pizza topping data seen in <xref ref="examp_graphs_organizing-data"/>.</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>Based on the <xref ref="examp_graphs_relative-frequency-table_table" text="custom">relative frequency table</xref> previously constructed for this data, we get the following pie graph.</p>
					<figure xml:id="fig_graphs_examp_pie-graph">

								<xi:include href="./latex-images/graphs_examp_pie-graph.tex" parse="text"/>
							</latex-image>
						</image>
					</figure>
					<p>Again, spreadsheet programs often convert relative frequencies into percents when constructing a pie graph.</p>
				</solution>
			</example>
			<p>There is one more situation involving qualitative variables which we must investigate.</p>
		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection xml:id="sec_graphs_qualitative_bivariate">
			<title>Bivariate Data</title>
			<p>The frequency tables and graphs that we&apos;ve looked at so far work well for <xref ref="def_num-vars" text="custom">univariate data</xref>. But they need to be modified before they will work with data involving more than one variable. <xref ref="def_num-vars" text="custom">Multivariate data</xref> can be very difficult to summarize and display graphically. Because of this, we usually just look at each variable separately. However when we have two variables (<xref ref="def_num-vars" text="custom">bivariate data</xref>) there are	some special techniques that we can use to summarize and display the data.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_contingency-table">
				<idx>contingency table</idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>contingency table</term>, also called a <term>two-way table</term>, is a table used to summarize bivariate qualitative data. The columns in this table represent the various categories of one of the two variables and the rows represent the categories of the other variable. In each cell (row-column combination) we record the number of subjects with that row category and column category.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>To see how a contingency table can be read, let&apos;s look at an example involving college students and summer vacation plans.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_graphs_contingency-table">
				<title>Using a Contingency Table</title>
				<statement>
					<p>Four hundred randomly selected college students are asked to give their class standing (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, or Senior) and their summer plans (work, play, or study). The following contingency table summarizes the results of this survey.</p>

					</table>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>The column labeled <em>Freshmen</em> has three rows corresponding to <em>work</em>, <em>play</em>, and	<em>study</em>. To get the number of Freshmen who are not working, we add together those who areplaying and those	who are studying which gives us <m>49+28 = 77</m>.</p>
				</solution>
			</example>
			<p>When we create a contingency table, or if we are just given a contingency table, we sometimes will want to look at each variable separately. In the example above, we may want to know how many of	these students intend to work this summer. To answer this question, we need to total up the rows and/or columns. These totals are typically displayed in the margins of the	table, leading to the	following definition.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_marginal-distribution">
				<idx>marginal distribution</idx>
				<idx><h>contingency table</h><h>marginal distribution</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>marginal distribution</term> of a contingency table is either the sums of the rows of that contingency table, or the sum of the columns of that contingency table.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>Let&apos;s find the marginal distributions for the student summer plans example	above.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_graphs_marginal-distribution">

		<title>Quantitative Data</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>When we wish to describe quantitative variables, we run into many of the same problems that we had with qualitative variables. The raw data itself is usually not very useful and must be summarized before we can construct graphs.</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection xml:id="sec_graphs_quantitative_tables">
			<title>Summarizing Quantitative Data with Tables</title>
			<p>Our first task is to	come up with a way to summarize this data in a table, like we did with <xref ref="def_frequency-table" text="custom">frequency tables</xref> for qualitative variables. To do this, we must create <q>categories</q> to use as the	rows for our table.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_frequency-distribution">
				<idx><h>frequency distribution</h></idx>
				<idx><h>frequency distribution</h><h>class</h></idx>
				<idx><h>frequency distribution</h><h>class width</h></idx>
				<idx><h>frequency distribution</h><h>upper class limit</h></idx>
				<idx>class width</idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>frequency distribution</term> is a table constructed to summarize quantative data. It has the following components:
						<ul>
							<li><p><term>Class</term><mdash/>the range of values taken on by the variable is broken up into sections called <term>classes</term>.</p></li>
							<li><p><term>Upper Class Limit</term><mdash/>the largest number that belongs to a class is called the <term>upper class limit</term>.</p></li>
							<li><p><term>Class Width</term><mdash/>the difference between the upper class limit of a given class and the upper class limit of the previous class (or the minimum value in the data set for the	first class) is called the <term>class width</term>. This value should almost always be the same for each class.</p></li>
						</ul>
						Once the classes have been established, we treat them as categories and count	the number of values that fall into each class.  We then create a table with a column giving the classes and a second column containing their frequencies.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>Note that although a frequency distribution will look very similar to a frequency table, there is a difference. Namely, we must break the range of values up into classes in order to construct our table. It is probably easiest to remember that a <term>frequency table</term> is used to summarize data from a qualitative variable, and a <term>frequency distribution</term> is used to summarize data from a quantitative	variable.</p>

			<p>Once we have summarized our data in a frequency distribution, we can of course create a relative frequency distribution by dividing each class frequency by the grand total. We can also create a representative graph, which we will learn about in the next section.</p>
		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection xml:id="sec_graphs_quantitative_histograms">
			<title>Histograms</title>
			<p>The graph that we use to describe data summarized by a frequency distribution is very similar to	the <xref ref="def_bar-graph" text="custom">bar graphs</xref> we used to summarize data from a frequency table. There is,	however, some important distinction.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_histogram">
				<idx>histogram</idx>

				<idx><h>graphs</h><h>histogram</h><seealso>histogram</seealso></idx>

					<p>A <term>histogram</term> is a graph for quantitative data in which each class in a frequency	distribution for that data is represented by a bar, the height of which corresponds to the frequency of that class.

				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>Note that in a histogram, the order is important because the classes of a frequency distribution are themselves ordered from smallest values to largest values. Also, note that the bars touch to show that the classes are contiguous--that is, there is no space between the classes. Let&apos;s try constructing a histogram for the tomato plant heights seen in the previous example. We use a spreadsheet to accomplish this, in much the same way that we constructed a bar graph.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_graphs_histogram">

			<p>One of the disadvantages of summarizing quantitative data with a frequency distribution and histogram is that you lose the specific values.  That is, you can not tell what the individual data values were before the summary was created.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_graphs_recovering-data">

				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>Looking just at the <xref ref="examp_graphs_frequency-distribution_frequency-distribution" text="custom">frequency distribution</xref> we created for this data, this is not possible.  If all we have is the frequency distribution, we can only tell that there are 10 plants between 14.1 and 16 inches tall.

				</solution>
			</example>
			<p>If we wish to create a pictorial representation of a set of quantitative data that also shows the raw data, we need a new type of graph.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_stem-and-leaf">

				<idx><h>graphs</h><h>stem-and-leaf plot</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>In a <term>stem-and-leaf plot</term>, data is represented by separating each value into two parts: the stem (all but the right-most digit) and leaf (
					right-most digit). A table is then constructed with a row for each stem with that stem in the first column and a list of all leaves which
					belong from that stem in the second column, given in ascending order with no spaces or commas between them.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>Stem-and-leaf plots are usually created by hand. Because of this, they are most useful for	relatively small data sets for which we wish to get a quick picture of the shape of the data. To get an accurate picture, it is important that each <q>leaf</q> take up the same amount of space. So if you are typing a stem-and-leaf plot into a computer, use a mono-spaced font such as courier so that the ones (1) don&apos;t take up less space than the eights (8).

		<subsubsection xml:id="sec_graphs_quantitative_interpreting">
		  <title>Interpreting Graphs</title>
		  <p>The reason that we create graphs in the first place is to help us better understand a set of data. It is therefore important that we know how to interpret the graphs that we create. In this class, we will spend most of our time working with univariate quantitative variables. We thus need to be sure that	we know how to interpret histograms. There are three major things to look for	in a histogram.</p>
		  <definition xml:id="def_histogram-center">
		  	<idx><h>histogram</h><h>center</h></idx>
		  	<statement>
		  		<p>The <term>center</term> of a histogram is the class that most accurately describes the typical value in the data set being described.</p>
		  	</statement>
		  </definition>
		  <definition xml:id="def_histogram-mode">
		  	<idx><h>histogram</h><h>mode</h></idx>
		  	<idx><h>histogram</h><h>unimodal</h></idx>
		  	<idx><h>histogram</h><h>bimodal</h></idx>
		  	<idx><h>histogram</h><h>multimodal</h></idx>
		  	<idx><h>histogram</h><h>uniform</h></idx>
		  	<statement>
		  		<p>One way to describe the shape of a histogram is based on the number and location of its modes. A <term>mode</term> is a class that contains significantly more data than the classes immediately	next to it. A histogram can be <term>unimodal</term> (one mode), <term>bimodal</term> (two modes),
					<term>multimodal</term> (more than two modes), or it may have no prominent modes in which case it is called <term>uniform</term>.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<definition xml:id="def_histogram-symmetry">
				<idx><h>histogram</h><h>symmetric</h></idx>
				<idx><h>histogram</h><h>skewed</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>Another way to describe the shape of a histogram is based on its <term>symmetry</term>. A histogram may be <term>symmetric</term> (meaning it has the same shape on the left and right of its center), <term>skewed right</term> (meaning that the right tail is longer than the left) or <term>skewed left</term> (meaning that the left tail is longer than the right).</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>We can tell a lot about the distribution of values of a single quantitative variable by describing the	histogram in these terms. Consider the following example.</p>

		<p>There are a few common errors in creating and using graphs that should be mentioned. The first	such error is commonly caused either by a <q>helpful</q> computer program with poorly chosen default settings, or by a person who is trying to manipulate the graph to <q>lie</q> with statistics.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_graphs_incorrect-axis">
			<title>Incorrect Vertical Axis</title>
			<statement>
				<p>The following frequency table gives the number of individuals in a recent study who said that they had full health insurance coverage, some health insurance coverage, and no health insurance coverage. Next to those numbers are two bar charts representing this data. Determine which bar chart is misleading, and explain why it is misleading.</p>

			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>Both bar charts were constructed using the same data from the same frequency table. But the first graph is accurate while the second is not. Notice that the vertical scale in <xref ref="fig_graphs_examp_incorrect-axis-a"/> starts at	0 while the vertical scale in <xref ref="fig_graphs_examp_incorrect-axis-b"/> begins at 80. This exaggerates the difference between the number of individuals with full coverage and those with some or no coverage.</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>This is one example of a problem caused by a violation of an important	principle in graphing.</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_area-principle">
			<idx>area principle (graphs)</idx>
			<idx><h>graphs</h><h>area principle</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>The <term>area principle</term> states that the area of any bar or sector in a graph representing a category in a frequency table or class in a frequency distribution must be in the same proportion to the rest of the graph as the frequency of the category or class is to the rest of the data in the table.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>By changing the starting point of the frequency axis in the second histogram above, we have violated the area principle. This makes the <q>full insurance</q> bar look much shorter in relation to the other two bars than the numbers indicate. Another common error in creating graphs is to violate the area principle by creating three dimensional graphs. Consider the following.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_graphs_3d-pie-graph">
			<title>A Three-Dimensional Pie Graph</title>
			<statement>
				<p>A store manager wishes to know the general age group into which most of his customers fall. He does a quick survey and comes up with the following fequency distribution. He then creates a pie graph to show the proportion of customers in each age group. Do you think his pie graph accurately represents the data from the frequency distribution?</p>

			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>This is not an accurate representation of the store manager&apos;s frequency distribution. Notice that the 0-20 year old age group looks like it may be the largest group based on the amount of gray on the graph. It seems to be three times as large as the 61+ group in the back of the graph.  However, the 21-40 year old group is in fact the largest and the 61+ group is only about twice as large as the 0-20 year group. By adding the 3D effects, the store manager has violated the area principle.</p>

		<p>The most important thing to remember from this section is that we must be sure not to sacrifice accuracy to create <q>pretty</q> looking graphs.</p>
