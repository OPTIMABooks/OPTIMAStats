  	<title>What Are Sampling Distributions?</title>
  	<p>Starting with our next section, we are going to be looking at how to make inferences (i.e. estimations or decisions) about a population based on what we observe in a sample. It is therefore important that we understand how sampling works, and in particular, how the sample mean and sample proportions work.  Recall that the <xref ref="def_mean" text="custom">mean of s sample</xref> containing values <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m> is computed as follows.
      <me>\overline{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+ x_n}{n}</me></p>
    <p>This formula should look familiar from <xref ref="sec_center-spread_mean-stdev"/>. We restate it here, however, to consider a question. If we select a sample of <m>n</m> values and look at their average over and over again, will we see more or less variation between these averages than we would if we look at the individual values in the population? We shall see that there is in fact less variation between the means of different samples than between individual values. This is because it is a lot harder to get a group of <m>n</m> individuals who all vary in the same way from the population average than it is to get a single individual who varies from the population average.</p>
    <p>Besides taking the average of some variable in a sample, we may also wish to examine the proportion of individuals in a sample who have some characteristic. This is similar to the binomial processes we studied in <xref ref="sec_binomial"/>. The only real difference is that instead of looking at <m>x</m>, the number of successes, we look at <m>\frac{x}{n}</m>, the proportion of successes.</p>
    <definition xml:id="def_sample-proportion">
    	<idx><h>sampling distribution</h><h>proportion</h><h>sample proportion</h></idx>
    	<statement>
    		<p>If a sample of size <m>n</m> is drawn from a population and <m>x</m> of those <m>n</m> individuals have some characteristic, then the sample proportion with that characteristic is:
    		  <me>\hat p = \frac{x}{n}</me>.</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>In this section, we will try to develop our understanding of how these sample statistics, <m>\overline x</m> and <m>\hat p</m> work. In particular, we will introduce an extremely important theorem called the <term>central limit theorem</term>.</p>

		<p>Note that several interesting things have happened. First, when we take the mean of all of our possible samples, we see repetition. That is, more than one sample produces the values <m>5</m>, <m>6</m>, and <m>7</m> as a mean. Consider the graphs below of the individual values from the population, which is uniform, versus the sample means, which is starting to look more mound shaped.</p>

		<p>Also notice that the distribution of sample means has less variation than the distribution of individual values from the population. Another interesting thing that has happened is that the expected value of <m>\overline X</m> is <m>6</m>, which is exactly the population mean. That is, when we take the mean of the sample means, the average of the averages, we get the same thing as the mean of the entire population.</p>
		<p>These two factors combined will play an important role on the next page, where we introduce one of the most important theorems in statistics.</p>

		<title>The Central Limit Theorem</title>
		<p>Making inferences about populations based on samples relies heavily on an understanding of how these samples behave. We must know what we can expect to see in samples that are drawn from a population with a uniform distribution, a normal distribution, or some other distribution. In the  previous subsection, we saw an example in which a sample drawn from a uniform distribution had sample means that had a more mound-shaped distribution. This is a particular instance of the next theorem.</p>

		</theorem>
		<p>According to the <term>central limit theorem</term>, if we take samples and look at their means, they will have approximately a normal distribution, and the bigger the sample we take, the better the sample means will match a normal distribution. How big does <m>n</m> need to be? That depends on the way the individual population values are distributed.</p>
		<principle xml:id="thm_central-limit-criteria">
			<title>Criteria for Applying the Central Limit Theorem</title>
			<idx><h>central limit theorem</h><h>criteria for use</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>We may use the normal distribution given by the central limit theorem to approximate probabilities for means of samples of size <m>n</m> when:

		<p>In the next several examples, we will be asked to find probabilities for sample means. It is important to remember that we must differentiate between the probability of an individual being in a certain range, and the probability of the mean of a sample being in that range. These probabilities will be different, and we must use the appropriate normal distribution for each one.</p>

				<p>Since the population has a normal distribution, we can use the central limit theorem.

From the central limit theorem, both <m>W</m> and <m>\overline W</m> will have the same mean, but the standard deviation for <m>\overline W</m> will be

						<li><p>The average time it takes a sample of 50 adults to complete this test will have a normal distribution (because <m>n \gt 30</m>) with mean 82.5 and standard deviation <me>\frac{13.1}{\sqrt{50}} \approx 1.853</me>.   The probability their mean score is at least 85 can be computed as shown.
						  <md>
						  	<mrow>P(\overline{X} \geq 85) \amp = P\left(\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \geq \frac{85-82.5}{1.853}\right)</mrow>
						  	<mrow>\amp = P(Z \geq 1.35)</mrow>
						  	<mrow>\amp = 1 - P(Z \lt 1.35)</mrow>
						  	<mrow>\amp = 1 - 0.9115</mrow>
						  	<mrow>\amp = 0.0885</mrow>
						  </md>
						  This is not likely, but not unusual either.</p>
						</li>
						<li><p>For a sample of 100 adults, the mean is still 82.5, but the standard deviation is now
						  <me>\frac{13.1}{\sqrt{100}} = 1.31</me>.
						  The probability computation therefore looks a little different.
						    <md>
							  	<mrow>P(\overline{X} \geq 85) \amp = P\left(\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \geq \frac{85-82.5}{1.31}\right)</mrow>
							  	<mrow>\amp = P(Z \geq 1.91)</mrow>
							  	<mrow>\amp = 1 - P(Z \lt 1.91)</mrow>
							  	<mrow>\amp = 1 - 0.9719</mrow>
							  	<mrow>\amp = 0.0281</mrow>
							  </md>
							So the probability that the group of 100 averages more than 85 minutes is about a fourth as likely as for the group of 50.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>The graph below shows the two sampling distributions that we used in this example.  Notice how much smaller the shaded area under the red curve (where <m>n=100</m>) is as compared to the blue (where <m>n=50</m>)</p>

  <subsection xml:id="sec_sampling_proportions">
  	<title>Sample Distribution of a Proportion</title>
  	<p>At the beginning of this section, we introduced the idea of a <xref ref="def_sample-proportion" text="custom">sample proportion</xref>. To help solidify this concept, the next example shows how we might compute such a proportion.</p>
  	<example xml:id="examp_sampling_proportions-compute">
  		<title>Computing a Sample Proportion</title>
  		<statement>
  			<p>In a sample of 200 butterflies, 75 were yellow monarchs. What is the proportion of yellow Monarch butterflies in this sample?</p>
  		</statement>
  		<solution>
  			<p>The sample proportion is the number of individuals who have the desired characteristic, which we call <m>x</m>, divided by the sample size, which is <m>n</m>. In this case,
  			  <me>\hat p = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{75}{200} = 0.375</me>.</p>
  		</solution>
  	</example>
  	<p>Note that we use <m>\hat p</m> for a proportion in a sample instead of <m>p</m>. The variable <m>p</m> was used in binomial probabilities where it stood for the probability of a success. Thought of another way, <m>p</m> is the proportion of individuals in the population with the desired characteristic. So <m>p</m> and <m>\hat p</m> really measure the likelihood of the same characteristic. It is just that one does it for the population and the other for a sample.</p>
  	<p>To understand how sample proportions will be distributed<mdash/>and thus how we can compute their probabilities<mdash/>we need to think back to <xref ref="sec_approximating" />. There we saw how to approximate binomial probabilities using a normal distribution. As long as the criteria for approximation was met, we could use a normal distribution to figure out <m>P(X=x)</m>, the probability of <m>x</m> successes in <m>n</m> trials.</p>
  	<p>How does this relate to proportions? A proportion in a sample is simply a ratio of the <m>x</m> successes to the <m>n</m> trials in a binomial process. Thus, the distribution of sample proportions will have a mean which is the mean of a binomial distribution divided by <m>n</m>. It will have a standard deviation which is the standard deviation of the binomial distribution divided by <m>n</m>. These formulas are summarized below.</p>
  	<theorem xml:id="thm_proportion-sampling-dist">
  		<title>Sampling Distribution for a Proportion</title>
  		<idx><h>sampling distribution</h><h>proportion</h></idx>
  		<statement>
  			<p>If <m>p</m> is the proportion of individuals in a population with a given characteristic and a sample of size <m>n</m> is drawn from that population, then the proportion of individuals in the sample with that characteristic, <m>\hat p</m>, will have a normal distribution with the following mean and standard deviation.</p>
  			<sidebyside width="30%" margins="10% 20%" valign="middle">
  				<p><me>\mu_{\hat p} = \frac{np}{n} = p</me></p>
  				<p><me>\sigma_{\hat p} = \frac{\sqrt{npq}}{n} = \sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}</me></p>
  			</sidebyside>
  			<p>This approximation is appropriate as long as both <m>n\times p</m> and <m>n\times q</m> are greater than 5.</p>
  		</statement>
  	</theorem>
  	<p>Note that we are not restricted to a sample size of 30 or more, as we are when using the central limit theorem for sample means. Instead, we must check to make sure that the <xref ref="def_binomial-approx-criteria" text="custom">criteria for approximating</xref> a binomial distribution with a normal distribution are met.  Namely, we need to verify that <m>n\times p</m> and <m>n\times q</m> are both greater than 5. Consider the following example.</p>
  	<example xml:id="examp_sampling_proportions_appropriate">
  		<title>Computing Probabilities for a Sample Proportion</title>
  		<statement>
  			<p>Only 2% of the world&apos;s population has naturally blond hair. Suppose that you were drawing a sample from the world population, and you wished to use a normal distribution to compute probabilities for the sample proportion, <m>\hat p</m>, of people with blond hair. How large a sample should you take?</p>
  		</statement>
  		<solution>
  			<p>In order to use a normal distribution to compute probabilities for <m>\hat p</m> we need to ensure that <m>n\times p</m> and <m>n\times q</m> are both greater than 5. Note that the <m>p</m> in this formula is the proportion of people in the population with blond hair, not the proportion in our sample. We therefore need to have
  			  <me>n\times p \gt 5 \Rightarrow n(0.02) \gt 5 \Rightarrow n \gt \frac{5}{0.02} \Rightarrow n \gt 250</me>.</p>
  			<p>Since <m>q = .98</m> is much larger than <m>p</m>, we do not need to check <m>n\times q</m>. We therefore must sample at least 251 individuals to apply the sampling distribution formulas above.</p>

  	<p>With this information in mind, we are ready to look at examples involving sample proportions. Several of these can be found below.</p>

  			<p>As seen in <xref ref="examp_sampling_proportions_appropriate"/>, only 2% of the world&apos;s population are naturally blond. Suppose that you take a sample of 500 individuals from the world population. What is the probability that you will find less than 1.5% of your sample has blond hair?</p>
  		</statement>
  		<solution>
  			<p>First note that <m>n\times p = 500(0.02) = 10</m> and <m>n\times q = 500(0.98) = 490</m> are both bigger than 5. We can therefore use the sampling distribution for a sample proportion. The mean and standard deviation are shown below.
  			  <md>
  			  	<mrow>\mu_{\hat p} \amp = p = 0.02</mrow>
  			  	<mrow>\sigma_{\hat p} \amp = \sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{(0.02)(0.98)}{500}} \approx 0.00626</mrow>
  			  </md>
  			Therefore, we can compute the probability that less than 1.5% of our sample has blond hair as follows.
  			  <md>

  	<example xml:id="examp_sampling_proportions_greater-than">
  		<title>Computing Probabilities for a Sample Proportion II</title>
  		<statement>
  			<p>A certain ballot measure needs 60% approval to pass. Suppose that there is actually 58% support for the ballot measure amongst registered voters. A polling organization wishes to determine if the ballot measure is likely to pass. To do this, they randomly select a sample of 900 registered voters. If they predict the measure will pass when <m>\hat p \geq 0.60</m>, what is the probability that they will mistakenly predict passage of the ballot measure?</p>
  		</statement>
  		<solution>
  			<p>Checking that we can apply the normal distribution, we compute <m>n\times p = 900(0.58) = 522</m> and <m>n\times q = 900(0.42) = 378</m>, both of which are greater than 5. Now the mean and standard deviation for our normal distribution of <m>\hat p</m> are:
  			  <md>
  			  	<mrow>\mu_{\hat p} \amp = 0.58</mrow>
  			  	<mrow>\sigma_{\hat p} \amp = \sqrt{\frac{(0.58)(0.42)}{900}} \approx 0.01645</mrow>
  			  </md>
  			Therefore, the probability that they mistaken predict passage of the ballot measure is:
  			  <md>
  			  	<mrow>P(\hat P \geq 0.60) \amp = P\left(\frac{\hat P - p}{\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}} \geq \frac{0.60 - 0.58}{0.01645}\right)</mrow>

  			  	<mrow>\amp = 1 - P(Z \lt 1.22)</mrow>
  			  	<mrow>\amp = 1 - 0.8888</mrow>
  			  	<mrow>\amp = 0.1112</mrow>
  			  </md>
  			So, there is approximately an 11% chance the polling organizaiton will get it wrong.</p>
  		</solution>
  	</example>
  	<p>The failure rate of 11% is not very good if one wants to develop a reputation for being reliable. How could the polling organization lower the likelihood that they make a wrong prediction? As we shall see in the next chapter, one method is to recognize that there is the possibility of an <q>error</q> in sampling. Therefore, the pollsters should not predict a win based on a sample proportion of 0.60. Another method is to lower the variation between samples by raising the sample size. If <m>n</m> gets bigger, <m>\sigma_{\hat p}</m> gets smaller, and the probability of being wrong will go down.</p>
