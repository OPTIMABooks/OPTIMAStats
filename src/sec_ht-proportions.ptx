  	<title>Testing Claims About a Proportion</title>
  	<p>The second type of hypothesis test that we will study is the test for a population proportion. The following situations will provide the examples for this section.
  	  <ul>
  	    <li><p>A pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug for the common cold. They claim that this drug shortens the duration of the cold in 80% of individuals. A physician believes that this proportion is inflated. He finds 115 individuals who have just developed a cold, administers the drugs, and observes that 89 of them recover more quickly than is typical.</p></li>
  	    <li><p>A government official claims that 50% of cars on the road have under-inflated tires, and are therefore getting less-than-optimal gas mileage. To test this claim, a random sample of 600 cars is selected and 279 of them are found to have under-inflated tires.</p></li>
  	    <li><p>A scout leader claims that being a boyscout promotes character development and respect for the law. In fact, he claims that fewer than 10% of boys who spend at least one year in a boyscout troupe will get into trouble with the law before their 20th birthday. To test this claim, you take a random sample of 80 names from the rosters of boyscout troupes fifteen years in the past and find that 11 of these former boyscouts have had trouble with the law.</p></li>

		<title>Formulating Hypotheses</title>
		<p>We start once more by identifying the null and alternative hypothesis. When testing a claim about a single population proportion, the three basic types of null/alternative hypothesis combinations are as follows.</p>

		  	  </ul>
		  	</p>
		  </statement>
	  </principle>
	  <p>Let&apos;s look at each of the three examples from the introduction and see if we can determine which of these sets of hypotheses should be used.</p>
	  <example xml:id="examp_ht-proportions_hypotheses-left-1">
	  	<title>Stating Hypotheses for a Left-Tailed Test</title>
	  	<statement>
	  		<p>A pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug for the common cold. They claim that this drug shortens the duration of the cold in 80% of individuals. A physician believes that this proportion is inflated. He finds 115 individuals who have just developed a cold, administers the drugs, and observes that 89 of them recover more quickly than is typical. Find the null and alternative hypotheses for this test.</p>
	  	</statement>
	  	<solution>
	  		<p>The physician&apos;s claim is that the proportion of 80% is too big. This does not involve inequality, and should therefore be the alternative hypothesis. This gives us a left-tailed test with the following hypotheses.
	  			<md>
	  				<mrow>H_0\amp:\ p \geq 0.80</mrow>
	  				<mrow>H_A\amp:\ p \lt 0.80</mrow>

To test this claim, a random sample of 600 cars is selected and 279 of them are found to have under-inflated tires. Find the null and alternative hypotheses for this test.</p>
	  	</statement>
	  	<solution>	  		
  			<p>The official&apos;s claim is that the proportion of cars on the road with under-inflated tires is exactly 50%. This involves equality, and is therefore the null hypothesis. The following are the hypotheses for this two-tailed test.
  				<md>

	  		<p>Finally, the scout leader claims that the proportion is less than 0.10. This is an alternative hypothesis since it does not involve equality. Therefore, we get a left-tailed test with hypotheses:

		<title>Computing the Test Statistic</title>
		<p>When testing a claim about a population proportion, the test statistic measures how unusual the observed sample is if the null hypothesis is true. The test statistic is really just a z-score for the sample proportion based on the assumption <m>p</m> is as indicated in the null hypothesis. Below we remind you of this formula in the context of a hypothesis test.</p>

			<statement>
				<p>The test statistic for a sample proportion <m>\hat p</m> used to test the assumption of the null hypothesis that <m>p = p_0</m> is:
				  <me>z_{\text{test}} = \frac{\hat p - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0q_0}{n}}}</me>.</p>
			</statement>
		</theorem>
		<p>When computing a test statistic, the null hypothesis must give us one value for <m>p</m>. In the case of a two-tailed test, the null hypothesis that <m>p = p_0</m> does just that. In a left- or right-tailed test, we use the <q>worst-case</q> value of <m>p_0</m> from the null hypothesis. That is, even if we have: 
		  <ul cols="2">
		  	<li><p><m>H_0:\ p \geq p_0</m>, or</p></li>
		  	<li><p><m>H_0:\ p \leq p_0</m></p></li>
		  </ul>
		  we will use <m>p = p_0</m> in computing our test statistic. Examples of this can be found as we continue working on the problems from the beginning of this section.

		<p>To conduct a traditional hypothesis test and draw conclusions, we must complete the following steps.

		</p>
		<p>We have already completed steps one and two. Thus, we have only to finish steps 3 and 4 to conduct a traditional hypothesis test in each of our examples.</p>

				<p>The p-value for our test statistic in this left-tailed test (because the alternative uses <m>\lt</m>) is the probability of getting a test statistic further into that left tail than -0.70.</p>

				<p>A government official claims that 50% of cars on the road have under-inflated tires, and are therefore getting less-than-optimal gas mileage. To test this claim, a random sample of 600 cars is selected and 279 of them are found to have under-inflated tires.

			<title>Conducting Another Left-Tailed p-Value Hypothesis Test</title>

				<p>A scout leader claims that being a boyscout promotes character development and respect for the law. In fact, he claims that fewer than 10% of boys who spend at least one year in a boyscout troupe will get into trouble with the law before their 20th birthday. To test this claim, you take a random sample of 80 names from the rosters of boyscout troupes fifteen years in the past and find that 11 of these former boyscouts have had trouble with the law. Conduct a p-value hypothesis test of this claim at the <m>\alpha = 0.01</m> significance level.</p>

		<title>Type I and Type II Errors</title>
		<p>Recall that part of the hypothesis testing process is the possibility of making errors. These errors come in two types, as outlined below.
			<ul>
				<li><title>Type I Error</title>
				  <p>This is the error of rejecting a null hypothesis even though it is true.</p></li>
				<li><title>Type II Error</title>
				  <p>This is the error of failing to reject the null hypothesis even though it is in fact wrong.</p></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Let&apos;s look back at two of our examples of hypothesis tests for proportions and see what these errors might look like in those cases.</p>

			<title>Detecting a Type II Error</title>
			<statement>
				<p>A pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug for the common cold. They claim that this drug shortens the duration of the cold in 80% of individuals. A physician believes that this proportion is inflated. He finds 115 individuals who have just developed a cold, administers the drugs, and observes that 89 of them recover more quickly than is typical. If you conduct a hypothesis test at the <m>\alpha = 0.05</m> significance level using this sample, and in actuality the drug is only effective in 75% of patients, what error will be made?</p>
