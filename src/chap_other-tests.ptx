  <title>Other Tests of Significance</title>
  <introduction>
    <title>Other Tests</title>
    <p>In this final chapter we will examine several additional hypothesis tests that are especially designed to help us make certain types of decisions.  These are:
      <ul>
        <li><title>The Analysis of Variance Test</title>
          <p>This test will help us determine if the means of more than two populations are equal or if at least one differs from the rest.</p></li>
        <li><title>The Goodness-of-Fit Test</title>
          <p>We use this test to see how well data from an observed frequency distribution fits a hypothesized distribution.</p></li>
        <li><title>Tests of Independence and Homogenaity</title>
          <p>Theses tests help us decide if observations that are classified using two variables in a <xref ref="def_contingency-table" text="custom">contingency table</xref> indicatest that the varaiables are dependent.</p></li>
      </ul>
