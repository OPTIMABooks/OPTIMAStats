  	<title>A Theoretical Approach</title>
  	<p>The simulations that we saw in the last section can be thought of as an experimental approach to understanding a random process. While this is a good way to investigate a random process, it can be time consuming and will yield different results each time it is performed, due to its random nature.</p>
  	<p>An alternative approach is to be more theoretical. Instead of simulating the process, we try to understand the process by counting the number of different outcomes that could happen and the number of outcomes that lead to each value of the response variable in which we are interested. In order to use this more theoretical approach, which we will talk more about in <xref provisional="sec_probability-rules" />, we first need to know how to count.</p>
  	<p>In this section we will introduce several important counting rules. Many of these rules may be familiar to you already. Some of them, however, will probably be new. We will focus not only on understanding the formulas that go with these counting rules, but also when to use each rule.</p>

	<subsection xml:id="sec_counting_addition">
		<title>Sets and the Addition Rule</title>
		<p>In this first section of the lesson, we will remind you of one of the most basic counting rules: the <term>addition rule</term>. We will also introduce the idea of set notation.</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_counting-rule-addition-informal">
			<statement>
				<p>If a process can happen in one of two distinct ways, the first way having <m>n</m>n different possibilities and the second having <m>m</m> possibilities, then the entire process can happen <m>n+m</m> ways.  This is referred to as the <term>addition rule</term>.</p>
		  </statement>
	  </definition>
	  <p>To see this counting rule in action, consider the following example.</p>
	  <example xml:id="examp_counting_addition-informal">
	  	<title>Using the Addition Rule</title>
	  	<statement>
	  		<p>You have won a church raffle. The winning ticket entitles you to choose either one of eight possible home-made pies, or one of six types of home-made cakes. In how many ways can you make your choice?</p>
	  	</statement>
	  	<solution>
	  		<p>Since you may choose either a pie <em>or</em> a cake, and none of your choices are <em>both</em> a pie and a cake, you have <m>8+6=14</m> choices, according to the addition rule.</p>
	  	</solution>
	  </example>
	  <p>Note the emphasized word <em>or</em> in the above solution. The addition rule can be thought of as going with the word <q>or</q> because we have one of two types of objects from which we must choose. In terms of mathematical sets, the word or goes with the notion of a <term>union</term>.</p>
	  <definition xml:id="def_union">
	  	<idx>union of two sets</idx>
	  	<idx><h>sets</h><h>union</h></idx>
	  	<statement>
	  		<p>The <term>union</term> of two sets, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, is <m>A\cup B</m>, the set containing all elements that are in <m>A</m> or in <m>B</m> (or both).</p>
	  	</statement>
	  </definition>
	  <p>The union of the pies and the cakes in <xref ref="examp_counting_addition-informal"/> above is the set of all 14 baked goods from which you can choose your prize. You may have also noticed that the word <em>both</em> was emphasized in the solution above. This is because it is important that when we use the addition rule, none of the choices be members of both groups<mdash/>that is, none of the elements are in both sets.  Being in both sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> also has a mathematical name.</p>
	  <definition xml:id="def_intersection">
	  	<idx>intersection of two sets</idx>
	  	<idx><h>sets</h><h>intersection</h></idx>
	  	<statement>
	  		<p>The <term>intersection</term> of two sets, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, is <m>A \cap B</m>, the set containing all elements that are in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.</p>
	  	</statement>
	  </definition>
	  <p>One way to keep the union and intersection straight is to associate them with the common English terms. If the word <q>or</q> is used, chances are that we are talking about a <term>union</term>. If the word <q>and</q> is used, we are probably referring to an <term>intersection</term>. In the case of the addition rule, we want to make sure that there are no items in both sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. That is, we want <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> to be <term>mutually exclusive</term>.</p>
	  <definition xml:id="def_mutually-exclusive">
	  	<idx>mutually exclusive</idx>
	  	<idx><h>sets</h><h>mutually exclusive</h></idx>
	  	<statement>
	  		<p>Two sets, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, are said to be <term>mutually exclusive</term> if their intersection is empty.  Symbolically, we write this as <m>A\cap B = \emptyset</m>.</p>
	  	</statement>
	  </definition>
	  <p>Using these more formal ideas involving sets, we can restate the addition rule as follows.</p>
	  <definition xml:id="def_counting-rule_addition">
	  	<idx>addition rule (counting)</idx>
	  	<idx><h>counting rules</h><h>addition rule</h></idx>
	  	<statement>
	  		<p>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are mutually exclusive sets, then the <term>addition rule</term> states that
	  		  <me>n(A\cup B) = n(A) + n(B)</me>,
	  		  where <m>n(A)</m> represents the number of elements in set <m>A</m>.</p>
	  	</statement>
	  </definition>
	  <p>The next example will give us a little more practice using sets and the addition rule.</p>
	  <example xml:id="examp_counting_addition-formal">

	  	<solution>
	  		<p><ol label="a">

	  			<li><p>According to the addition rule, because <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are mutually exclusive, <m>n(A\cup B) = n(A) + n(B) = 3 + 3 = 6</m>.</p></li>
	  			<li><p><m>A\cap C = \lbrace a,c \rbrace</m> because those are the elements in both <m>A</m> and <m>C</m>.</p></li>
	  			<li><p>We can not use the addition rule because <m>A\cap C</m> is not empty.</p></li>
	  			<li><p><m>A\cup C = \lbrace a,b,c,1,2 \rbrace</m>. Note that <m>n(A\cup C) = 5</m> (there are 5 things in <m>A\cup C</m>, but <m>n(A) + n(C) = 3+4 = 7</m>). The addition rule fails because the intersection was not empty.</p></li>

	<subsection xml:id="sec_counting_inclusion-exclusion">
		<title>Inclusion/Exclusion Rule</title>
		<p>The addition rule only applies if the two sets whose union we are counting are mutually exclusive. What do we do then if we are asked to count the union of two sets that are not mutually exclusive?</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_counting_includion-exclusion_double">
			<title>Avoiding Double Counting</title>
			<statement>
				<p>Mary is enrolled in a statistics class and a religion class this term. There are 23 total students, including Mary, in her statistics class.  There are 34 in her religion class. Again including Mary, 10 people are taking both classes. How many people are in the two classes combined?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>If the two classes were <xref ref="def_mutually-exclusive" text="custom">mutually exclusive</xref>, then we could use the addition rule to get <m>23+34 = 57</m>57 total people. However, doing this would double-count the 10 people who took both classes. To remedy this, we compute <m>23+34-10=47</m>, subtracting out those who were double-counted.</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>In the above example, those who were in both classes are included in both the 23 and the 34. So to make up for the fact that they were counted twice, we have to subtract them back out, or exclude them, to get the final total.</p>

		<title>The Multiplication Rule</title>
		<p>In some instances, a process may have two or more steps, each of which can happen in several different ways. In order to determine the total number of ways that such a multi-step process can happen, we need to use a new rule, called the <term>multiplication rule</term>.</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_counting-rule_multiplication">
			<idx>multiplication rule (counting)</idx>

				<p>This can be expanded to a process which includes <m>k</m> stages, the <m>i^\text{th}</m> of which can happen in <m>n_i</m> ways, then the total number of ways the process can happen is:
				<me>n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_k</me>.</p>

					So the total number of configurations is:

		<p>Notice that we can model a particular sequence of choices in this process by following a path through the tree. For example, in the second tree diagram, going along the third branch to pant 3, then the first branch to shirt 1, and then the second branch to shoes 2 gives us one complete outfit. Therefore, the total number of outfits is the same as the total number of branches at the last step.</p>
		<p>There are some instances where the number of choices we have at a given step depends on the choice we made at the previous step. In these cases the multiplication rule will not work. However, a tree diagram can still be a useful tool for counting the total number of ways to complete such a process.</p>

		<title>Factorials</title>
		<p>Let&apos;s look at an example that gives a special case of the multiplication rule.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_counting_factorial_trolls">
			<title>Arranging Items</title>
			<statement>
				<p>You wish to arrange your four most treasured possessions: your troll doll, Darth Vader action figure, toy Ewok, and GI Joe doll, in a row on your desk. In how many ways can you order these four items?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>This is an example of the multiplication rule using the following steps.
					<ol>
						<li><p>Chose which of the 4 items to place first (4 choices)</p></li>
						<li><p>Choose which of the 3 remaining items to place 2nd (3 choices)</p></li>
						<li><p>Choose which of the 2 remaining items to place 3rd (2 choices left)</p></li>
						<li><p>Choose which of the 1 remaining items to place at the end of the row (only one choice).</p></li>
					</ol>
					Therefore, according to the multiplication rule, the number of orderings is:
					<me> 4\times 3\times 2 \times 1 = 24</me>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>Notice that because we were selecting from our group of items without replacing them, the number of choices went down by one each time. When we use the multiplication rule with this sort of process, we wind up multiplying the numbers between 1 and the original number of choices. This product has a special name.</p>

		<title>Permutations</title>
		<p>In some counting problems, we will find a process that looks much like the <q>factorial</q> questions from the last page, but in which we are not asked to use up or arrange all of the items. One such example can be found below.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_counting_permutation_runners">
			<title>Ordering a Subset</title>
			<statement>
				<p>Suppose that ten runners compete in a race in which first, second, and third prizes are awarded. In how many ways can these prizes be won?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>Using the multiplication rule, the steps in this process are:
					<ol>
						<li><p>Award first prize to the winner (10 choices since anybody could win).</p></li>
						<li><p>Award second prize (9 choices since the winner is excluded).</p></li>
						<li><p>Award third prize (8 choices).</p></li>
					</ol>
					This gives the following total number of ways that the prizes can be won:
					<me>10\times 9\times 8 = 720</me>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>While the solution to this problem started off looking like a factorial, <m>10 \times 9 \times 8</m>, it stopped after 8 because we didn&apos;t need to order the remaining seven runners in this race.

				<p>A <term>permutation</term> of n items taken r at a time is used to count the number of ways to arrange (or permute) <m>r</m> items chosen from <m>n</m> possible items. The formula for this permutation is:
				<me>P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}</me>.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>Applying this formula to the foot-race example above, we could have computed:
			<me>P(10,3) = \frac{10!}{(10-3)!} = \frac{10\times 9\times 8\times 7!}{7!} = 10\times 9\times 8 = 720</me>.
			Permutations are a general rule that can be used to count the number of ways to complete a process in which the order of completion matters. A race is a good example of when order matters. Another example can be found below.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_counting_permutation_bands">
			<title>Using Permutations</title>
			<statement>
				<p>Six bands have expressed interest in performing at a concert with time slots for three performances. In how many ways can the concert manager make up a schedule for the concert?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>Since there are 6 bands to choose from, and only 3 are needed, and since the order of performance matters (changing the order would make a different schedule) the number of ways to schedule these bands is:
					<me>P(6,3) = \frac{6!}{3!} = 6\times 5\times 4 = 120</me>.</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>There are a few general rules which work no matter what <m>n</m> is used in a permutation. Three of these are shown below.
		  <ul>
		  	<li><p><m>P(n,n) = \frac{n!}{(n-n)!} = \frac{n!}{0!} = n!</m></p></li>
		  	<li><p><m>P(n,0) = \frac{n!}{(n-0)!} = \frac{n!}{n!} = 1</m></p></li>
		  	<li><p><m>P(n,1) = \frac{n!}{(n-1)!} = \frac{n\times (n-1)!}{(n-1)!} = n</m></p></li>
		  </ul>
		  Additionally, there is a short-cut that can be used instead of the formula. This is:
		  <me>P(n,r) = \underbrace{n\times (n-1) \times \cdots \times (n-r+1)}_{r \text { items}}</me>.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_counting_permutation_compute">

		<title>Combinations</title>
		<p>Permutations are particularly useful when the order in which we select individuals makes a difference<mdash/>such as in running a race or creating a schedule. But order does not always matter, as seen in the next example.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_counting_combination_movies">
			<title>Counting when Order Doesn&apos;t Matter</title>
			<statement>
				<p>You have two extra movie tickets and wish to share them with two of your four good friends. In how many ways can you pick the friends to go with you to the movies?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>Let&apos;s say that your friends names are: Alice, Bob, Candace, and David. If you try to count this using a permutation, you get:
					<me>P(4,2) = 4\times 3 = 12</me>.
					Unfortunately, this is not the correct answer. Consider the actual list of possible choices that this produces.</p>
				<table>
					<title>Possible Selections</title>
					<tabular>
						<row>
							<cell>AB</cell>
							<cell>AC</cell>
							<cell>AD</cell>
							<cell>BA</cell>
							<cell>BC</cell>
							<cell>BD</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell>CA</cell>
							<cell>CB</cell>
							<cell>CD</cell>
							<cell>DA</cell>
							<cell>DB</cell>
							<cell>DC</cell>
						</row>
					</tabular>
				</table>
				<p>Notice that each pair appears twice. For example, AB and BA are counted separately. This is because in a permutation, the order in which we hand out the tickets makes a difference. But really, we don&apos;t care who got the first ticket<mdash/>we just want to know who is going. Since there are two of each possible pairs, the actual number of ways to pick the two friends to go with us is:
				<me>\frac{P(4,2)}{P(2,2)} = \frac{12}{2} = 6</me>.</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>In the example above, we arrived at the final solution using two steps. First, we counted the number of ways to pick the friends to go with us if the order did matter, in this case it was 12. Then we counted the number of ways that those two friends could be arranged, which was 2. Finally, we divide the 12 ordered ways by the 2 different orderings to get a total of 6 ways to choose our two friends if the order does not matter. This process can be combined into a single counting rule called a combination.</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_combination">
			<idx>combination</idx>
			<idx><h>counting rules</h><h>combination</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>A <term>combination</term> of <m>n</m> items taken <m>r</m> at a time is used to count the number of ways to choose <m>r</m> items from <m>n</m> possible items if the order in which we select them does not matter. The formula for this combination is:
				<me>C(n,r) = \frac{P(n,r)}{r!} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}</me>.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>Applying this formula to the movie ticket example, we get:
			<me>C(4,2) = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4\times 3\times 2!}{2!\times 2!} = \frac{4\times 3}{2\times 1} = 6</me>.</p>
		<p>Let&apos;s try applying this to another example.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_counting_combination_committee">
			<title>Using a Combination</title>
			<statement>
				<p>A committee of 10 business executives wishes to choose a sub-committee of 3 to research a certain topic. In how many ways can this sub-committee be chosen?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>The order in which a sub-committee is selected does not matter<mdash/>a person is either on the committee or not on the committee. Therefore, this is a combination and the solution is:
				<me>C(10,3) = \frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \frac{10\times 9\times 8 \times 7!}{3!\times 7!} = \frac{10\times 9\times 8}{3\times 2\times 1} = 120</me>.</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>As with permutations, there are a few general rules that combinations follow no matter what the value of <m>n</m> is. Several of these rules are shown below.
		  <ul>
		  	<li><p><m>C(n,n) = 1</m></p></li>
		  	<li><p><m>C(n,1) = n</m></p></li>
		  	<li><p><m>C(n,r) = C(n,n-r)</m></p></li>
		  </ul></p>
		<p>And finally, a short-cut that can be easier to use than the formula above. 
		 	<me> C(n,r) = \frac{\overbrace{n\times (n-1) \times \cdots \times (n-r+1)}^{r \text{ values}}}{r!}</me>.</p>
		<p>We finish with an example of how these rules and shortcuts can be useful.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_counting_combination_compute">

		<title>Mixed Counting Techniques</title>
		<p>One of the hardest parts of counting problems is determining which rules or combinations of rules to use to answer a given question. Here are a few basic things to remember:
			<ol>
				<li><p>If the things you are counting come in two distinct groups, count each group then add together the results. (<xref ref="def_counting-rule_addition" text="custom">addition rule</xref> <mdash/> goes with <q>or</q>)</p></li>
				<li><p>If there is overlap between the two groups, remember to subtract the intersection. (<xref ref="def_counting-rule_inclusion-exclusion" text="custom">inclusion/exclusion rule</xref>)</p></li>
				<li><p>If the process you are counting can be broken down into steps, count the number of ways each step can be performed and multiply. (<xref ref="def_counting-rule_multiplication" text="custom">multiplication rule</xref> <mdash/> goes with <q>and</q>)</p></li>
				<li><p>If you are arranging things or selecting multiple items and the order of selection matters, use a permutation. (<xref ref="def_permutation">permutation rule</xref>).</p></li>
				<li><p>If you are selecting multiple items from a group of items and the order in which you pick them does not matter, use a combination. (<xref ref="def_combination" text="custom">combination rule</xref>).</p></li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>Let&apos;s apply these ideas to several examples. Remember that our fist step should always be to identify the rule or rules that we are going to use to count our options.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_counting_mixed_permutation">
			<title>Picking a Counting Rule</title>
			<statement>
				<p>The back row of Professor Duncan&apos;s classroom has only 4 seats. There are 8 students who wish to sit in these seats. In how many ways can the seats be assigned?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>In a seating chart, the order would matter. This must therefore be a permutation, and the solution is:
					<me>P(8,4) = 8\times 7\times 6\times 5 = 1680</me>.</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<example xml:id="examp_counting_mixed_two-combinations">
			<title>Combining Counting Rules</title>
			<statement>
				<p>A committee contains 6 men and 3 women. Four members of the committee are selected for a fact-finding junket. In how many ways can these four be selected if three of them are men and one is a woman?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>The order in which we pick members of a committee to go on a trip does not matter<mdash/>a member either goes on the trip or does not. However, notice that we have two steps to this problem.
				<ol>
				  <li><p>Pick the three men to go on the trip.</p></li>
				  <li><p>Pick the one woman to go on the trip.</p></li>
				</ol>
				The number of ways to pick the three men from the 6 male committee members is:
				<me>C(6,3) = \frac{6\times 5\times 4}{3\times 2\times 1} = 20</me>.
				The number of ways to pick the one woman is:
				<me>C(3,1) = 3</me>.
				Therefore, using the multiplication rule, the total number of ways to pick the four people to go on the junket is:
				<me>C(6,3)\times C(3,1) = 20\times 3 = 60</me>.</p>
			</solution>

			<statement>
				<p>Trains arrive at a station in random order from Berlin, Munich, Salzberg, Vienna, and Hamburg. In how many ways can the trains arrive so that the train from Berlin arrives immediately after the train from Salzberg?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>This problem specifically mentions the order of the trains, so the order will matter. However, we are not asked in how many ways the trains can arrive in general, which would be <m>P(5,5) = 5!</m>.</p>
				<p>Instead, we specify that the Berlin and Salzberg train must arrive one after the other. Symbolically, we want to arrange the following four trains in order: BS, M, V, H. BS is listed together because of the condition mentioned above. We can order these in <m>P(4,4) = 4! = 24</m> ways.</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<example xml:id="examp_counting_mixed_at-least">
			<title>Couting Cases with <q>At Least</q></title>
			<statement>
				<p>A deli sells 6 types of salads, 8 types of sandwiches, and 3 types of chips. Picnic baskets can be purchased which contain 4 different items from these 17. How many different picnic baskets can be made to contain at least two different sandwiches?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>This is actually the most challenging problem in this section. The reason is that we have to use both the multiplication rule to split the process into steps, and the addition rule to split the process into cases. Here&apos;s how we do it:
					<ul>
						<li><title>Case 1</title><p>Pick two from 8 sandwiches and 2 from the remaining 9 items
						  <me>C(8,2)\times C(9,2) = \frac{8\times 7}{2\times 1}\times\frac{9\times 8}{2\times 1} = 1008</me>.</p></li>
						<li><title>Case 2</title><p>Pick three sandwiches from 8 available and 1 item from remaining 9
						  <me>C(8,3)\times C(9,1) = \frac{8\times 7\times 6}{3\times 2\times 1} \times 9 = 504</me>.</p></li>
						<li><title>Case 3</title><p>Pick four sandwiches from 8 available and none of the remaining 9 items
						  <me>C(8,4)\times C(9,0) = \frac{8\times 7\times 6\times 5}{4\times 3\times 2\times 1}\times 1 = 70</me>.</p></li>
					</ul>
				Note that these three cases are mutually exclusive based on the number of sandwiches chosen, and that a picnic basket with at least two sandwiches would fall into one of these cases. So using the addition rule, the total number of picnic baskets is:
				<me>1008 + 504 + 70 = 1582</me>.</p>
			</solution>
