  <title>Collecting and Describing Data</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Many people are either dismissive of statistics (after all, you can prove 
      anything with statistics, right?) or find the topic intimidating. However,
      a good understanding of statistics will help us to answer real-world 
      questions such as the ones below.
      <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Candidate X has 47% support from the voting public with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4%. Is it possible that candidate X is supported by a majority of voters?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Mark scored in the 84th percentile on his achievement test scores. How could you explain to Mark's parents what this means?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>A nurse needs to compare the rate of absorption of a drug in men and women to detect any differences.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sally needs to decide if the decline in sales in her small business is significant, or if it just a temporary fluctuation.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      As answering any of these questions involves working with data, we begin our study 
      of statistics with an examination of data and data collection.
