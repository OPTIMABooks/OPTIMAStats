  <introduction xml:id="sec_probability_intro">
  	<title>Theoretical Probability</title>
  	<p>With a list of counting rules and simulation techniques, we are now ready to formally introduce the notion of <term>probability</term>. Probability is something that we use in many different ways in every-day life. Consider the following examples.
  	  <ul>
  	  	<li><p>A weather forecaster predicts that there is a 20% chance of rain tomorrow.</p></li>
  	  	<li><p>A news cast predicts that the probability a ballot measure will pass is 60%.</p></li>
  	  	<li><p>The lottery introduces a new scratch ticket in which the odds of winning are 1 in 200.</p></li>
  	  </ul>
  	  In each of these cases, we are measuring how likely a certain event is to take place. This is probability.</p>
  	  <p>Probabilities can be computed in several different ways. The simulations that we saw in <xref ref="sec_simulation"/> lead to the following type of probability computation.</p>
  	<definition xml:id="def_experimental-probability">
	  	<idx>experimental probability</idx>
	  	<idx><h>probability</h><h>experimental</h></idx>
	  	<statement>
  		  <p>The <term>experimental probability</term>, also called the <term>relative frequency probability</term>, of a certain event <m>A</m> happening in an experiment is found by simulating the experiment and taking the ratio of the number of trials resulting in <m>A</m> to the total number of trials. That is:
  		  <me>P(A) = \frac{\text{number of times }A\text{ occurred}}{\text{number of trials}}</me>.</p>
  		</statement>
  	</definition>
  	<p>On the other hand, if we use our counting rules to examine the experiment from a more theoretical point of view, we get the following type of probability.</p>
  	<definition xml:id="def_theoretical-probability">
  		<idx>theoretical probability</idx>
  		<idx><h>probability</h><h>theoretical</h></idx>
  		<statement>
  			<p>The <term>theoretical probability</term> of a certain event <m>A</m> happening in an experiment is found by counting the number of possibly outcomes of the experiment in which <m>A</m> happens and dividing by the total number of outcomes, assuming each outcome is equally likely. That is:
  			<me>P(A) = \frac{\text{number of ways }A\text{ can occur}}{\text{number of possible outcomes}}</me>.</p>
  		</statement>
  	</definition>
  	<p><idx><h>probability</h><h>subjective</h></idx>Another type of probability, called <term>subjective probability</term>, is basically just an educated guess of how likely an event is to occur based on one&apos;s previous experience. In this section we will learn about the basic rules and terms of probability, how to illustrate probabilities using pictures called <term>Venn Diagrams</term>, how to compute probabilities of related events, and finally how to compute theoretical probabilities in experiments in which each outcome is equally likely.</p>

		<title>Basic Probability Rules</title>
		<p>Before we start discussing the basic rules of probability, it is important to clarify some terminology that has already been used in the introduction. Consider the following example.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_probabilty_basic-rules_coin-flip">
			<title>Analyzing a Simple Experiment</title>
			<statement>
				<p>A fair coin is flipped twice, and the number of heads is noted. What is the probability that exactly one heads appears in these two flips?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>To better understand this question, let&apos;s look at two important sets. The first set is called the <term>sample space</term> and typically named <m>S</m>. It and contains all of the possible outcomes of this experiment.  In this case:
				<me>S = \lbrace HH, HT, TH, TT \rbrace</me>.</p>
				<p>The second set is the set containing all of the outcomes from S which meet our criteria of having exactly one heads. Any subset of the sample space is called an <term>event</term>.  For this problem, the event of interest is:
				<me>A = \lbrace HT, TH \rbrace</me>.</p>
				<p>If we assume that each of the outcomes is equally likely (see a <xref ref="sec_probability_counting"/>), then 
					<me>P(A) = \frac{ n(A)}{n(S)} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.50</me>.</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>In the example above, there are two sets pointed out. The names of these two sets are of particular importance.</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_sample-space">
			<idx>sample space</idx>
			<idx><h>probability</h><h>sample space</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>The <term>sample space</term> for an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<definition xml:id="def_event">
			<idx>event</idx>
			<idx><h>probability</h><h>event</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>An <term>event</term> for a particular experiment is a subset of the sample space for that experiment.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>In <xref ref="examp_probabilty_basic-rules_coin-flip"/>, the event of interest was <m>A = \lbrace HT, TH \rbrace</m>. Notice that every outcome in that event is also an outcome in the sample space <m>S</m>. This is what it means to say that <m>A</m> is a <idx><h>sets</h><h>subset</h></idx><term>subset</term> of <m>S</m>. Also notice that because <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>, it must always be true that <m>A</m> contains at most the same number of elements as <m>S</m>. That is, <m>n(A) \leq n(S)</m>. This, together with our definition of <xref ref="def_theoretical-probability" text="custom">theoretical probability</xref>, leads to the following rules.</p>
		<theorem xml:id="thm_basic-probability">
			<title>Basic Probability Rules</title>
			<idx><h>probability</h><h>rules</h><h>basic probability rules</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>For any event <m>A</m> in a sample space <m>S</m>, the following rules must hold.
				  <ul cols="2">
				  	<li><p><m>0 \leq P(A) \leq 1</m></p></li>
				  	<li><p><m>P(S) = 1</m></p></li>
				  </ul>
				</p>
			</statement>
		</theorem>
		<p>The first rule says that because <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>, the ratio of <m>n(A)</m> to <m>n(S)</m> can be at most one, and as with any ratio, must be at least 0. The second rule tells us that the probability of something in the sample space happening is 1. Since the sample space contains all possible outcomes, this gives us the maximum possible probability of 1. The following Scale can be useful in judging how likely something is to happen based on its probability.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>Let&apos;s apply these basic rules and interpretations to the following example.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_probability-riles_basic">
			<title>Applying Probability Rules to Events</title>
			<statement>
				<p>A sample space <m>S</m> contains two <xref ref="def_mutually-exclusive" text="custom">mutually exclusive</xref> events, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> with probabilities <m>P(A) = 0.6</m> and <m>P(B) = 0.2</m>. Use this to answer the following questions.
				<ol label="a">
					<li><p>Which event is more likely to occur, <m>A</m> or <m>B</m>?</p></li>
					<li><p>What is the probability that either <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> will occur?</p></li>
					<li><p>What if you were told that <m>C</m> is another event in the sample space with <m>P(C) = 7</m>?</p></li>
				</ol></p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p><ol label="a">
					<li><p>Because <m>P(A)</m> is larger (closer to 1) than <m>P(B)</m>, <m>A</m> is more likely to occur than <m>B</m>.</p></li>
					<li><p>Because <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are mutually exclusive (have no intersection), the number of ways that <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> (<xref ref="def_union" text="custom"><m>A</m> union <m>B</m></xref>) can occur is the sum <m>n(A) + n(B)</m>. Therefore, 
					<me>P(A\cup B) = \frac{n(A\cup B)}{n(S)} = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)} + \frac{n(B)}{n(S)} = P(A) + P(B)</me>.
					Thus, in our case, the probability that <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> will occur is <m>0.6 + 0.2 = 0.8</m></p></li>
					<li><p>Finally, based on the rules above, it is impossible to have an event <m>C</m> with <m>P(C) = 7</m>. Remember that probabilities are always between 0 and 1.</p></li>
				</ol></p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>Part (b) in the above example is a specific instance of the following general rule. This rule comes directly from the addition counting rule, so it has a similar name.</p>

  <subsection xml:id="sec_probability_measure">
  	<title>Valid Probability Measures</title>
  	<p>The simplest events for a particular experiment are the individual outcomes<mdash/>that is, the elements of the sample space. Each outcome can be assigned a probability based on the process being modeled. Consider the following example.</p>
  	<example xml:id="examp_probability_measure_urn">
  		<title>Assigning Probabilities to Outcomes</title>
  		<statement>
  			<p>An urn contains four red marbles, three blue marbles, two green marbles, and one white marble. A marble is drawn and its color is noted. Find the sample space in this experiment, and assign each outcome a probability.</p>
  		</statement>
  		<solution>
  			<p>First, we must find the sample space. There are two ways we could look at this.
  				<ol>
  					<li><p>We could pretend that we can tell each marble apart, regardless of its color. In that case, the sample space is:
  						<me>S = \lbrace R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, B_1, B_2, B_3, G_1, G_2, W_1 \rbrace</me>.</p></li>
  					<li><p>Since we can&apos;t actually tell the marbles of the same color apart, it is more accurate to say that the sample space is:
  						<me>S = \lbrace R, B, G, W\rbrace</me>.</p></li>
  				</ol>
  				The best answer for the sample space is <m>S = \lbrace R,B,G, W\rbrace</m> as shown in (2). However, the sample space from (1) can be a good way to answer the second part of the problem, what probability each outcome should have.
  				<ul label="" cols="2">
  					<li><p><m>P(R) = \frac{n(R)}{n(S)} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5} = 0.40</m></p></li>
  					<li><p><m>P(B) = \frac{n(B)}{n(S)} = \frac{3}{10} = 0.30</m></p></li>
  					<li><p><m>P(G) = \frac{n(G)}{n(S)} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} = 0.20</m></p></li>
  					<li><p><m>P(W) = \frac{n(W)}{n(S)} = \frac{1}{10} = 0.10</m>.</p></li>
  				</ul>
  			</p>
  		</solution>
  	</example>
  	<p>Note that in the above example, the probabilities of the individual outcomes were <m>0.40</m>, <m>0.30</m>, <m>0.20</m>, and <m>0.10</m>. The sum of all of these probabilities is, not surprisingly, the probability of the sample space, 1. This is a specific application of the addition rule we saw on the previous page. Using this observation, let's work on another example.</p>
  	<example xml:id="examp_probability_measure_missing-outcome">
  		<title>Finding a Missing Outcome Probability</title>
  		<statement>
  			<p>A sample space <m>S = \lbrace O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4 \rbrace</m>. Outcome <m>O_1</m> is twice as likely as outcome <m>O_2</m>. Outcomes <m>O_2</m> and <m>O_3</m> have the same probability. Finally, outcome <m>O_4</m> is three times as likely as outcome <m>O_1</m>. What is the probability of each of these outcomes?</p>
  		</statement>
  		<solution>
  			<p>To solve this problem, we need to assign a variable to the smallest probability. In this case, the probabilities of outcomes <m>O_2</m> and <m>O_3</m> are equal and we will call them both <m>x</m>. That means that the probability of outcome <m>O_1</m> is <m>2x</m>, and the probability of outcome <m>O_4</m> is <m>3(2x) = 6x</m>. Putting this all together,
  			<me>1 = P(S) = P(O_1) + P(O_2) + P(O_3) + P(O_4) = 2x + x + x + 6x = 10x</me>.</p>
  			<p>Therefore, <m>x = \frac{1}{10} = 0.10</m>. From the above discussion, we know that <m>P(O_1) = 0.20</m>, <m>P(O_2) = 0.10</m>, <m>P(O_3) = 0.10</m>, and <m>P(O_4) = 0.60</m>.</p>
  		</solution>
  	</example>
		<p>When each outcome in the sample space has been assigned a valid probability, between 0 and 1,and the sum of those probabilities is one, probabilities make up a valid probability measure.</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_probability-measure">
			<idx><h>probability</h><h>probability measure</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>An assignment of probabilities to the outcomes in a sample space in such a way as to ensure that each outcome has a probability between 0 and 1, and the sum of these probabilities is 1 is called a valid <term>probability measure</term>.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<example xml:id="examp_probability_measure_validity">
			<title>Constructing Probability Measures</title>

				<p>We start with a valid probability measure.
					<me>P(O_1) = 0.2, \quad P(O_2) = 0.3, \quad P(O_3) = 0.5.</me>
					This is a valid assignment of probabilities because each probability is between 0 and 1, and the sum of the probabilities is 1.</p>
				<p>Now let&apos;s look at an invalid probability measure.

  <subsection xml:id="sec_probability_counting">
  	<title>Probability from Counting</title>
  	<p>We have assumed in this section that each outcome is equally likely. In <xref ref="examp_probability_measure_urn"/> we pulled colored marbles from an urn in which each marble was equally likely, but not each color. This was because there were more marbles of some colors than others. In this example, we start to see how counting can be an important tool for computing probabilities.</p>
  	<p>Recall the definition of <xref ref="def_theoretical-probability">theoretical probability</xref>. Using the rule given in that definition, we can now answer several more complicated probability questions. In the examples that follow, we will use several different counting rules to help us compute probabilities.  Notice how in each example we must first figure out which counting rule or rules to select and how to combine them to count the number of outcomes in both the sample space and in the event we which to find the probability of.</p>
  	<example xml:id="examp_probability_counting_basic">
  		<title>Using Basic Counting Rules to Compute Probability</title>
  		<statement>
  			<p>An elderly woman owns 12 cats. She has 3 male tabby cats, 4 female tabby cats, 3 female calico, and 2 male Siamese cats. A single cat is chosen from the herd at random. Find the probability that the cat is:
  				<ol label="a" cols="3">

  					<li><p>a tabby cat</p></li>
  					<li><p>a male or a calico.</p></li>
  				</ol>
  			</p>
  		</statement>
  		<solution>
  			<p>Since we are told the cat is chosen at random, we know that each cat is equally likely to be chosen. Thus, we can use the theoretical probability rule above to solve these problems. For each of these events, note that the sample space is all of the cats owned by this woman. So <m>n(S) = 12</m> in each problem. 
  			<ol label="a">
  				<li><p>Since we are told that <m>n(M) = 5</m>, we compute <m>P(M) = \frac{5}{12}</m>.</p></li>
  				<li><p>Because <m>n(T) = 7</m>, we get <m>P(T) = \frac{7}{12}</m>.</p></li>
  				<li><p>Finally, <m>n(M \cup C) = 5 + 3 = 8</m>, so <m>P(M\cup C) = \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3}</m>.</p></li>
  			</ol></p>
  		</solution>
  	</example>
  	<p>A process in which we choose one item, as we chose a single cat above, is often much easier to work with than a process in which we must choose two or more items. Consider the next example.</p>
  	<example xml:id="examp_probability_counting_steps">
  		<title>Computing Probabilities with Permutations and Combinations</title>
  		<statement>
  			<p>A special deck of cards contains only 10 cards. These are the two black aces, two red kings, all four queens, and the two red jacks from the regular deck. Four cards are drawn at random from the deck without replacement. What is the probability that:
  				<ol label="a">
  					<li><p>none of the cards are aces?</p></li>
  					<li><p>two of the cards are black, and two are red?</p></li>
  					<li><p>at least one of the cards is a queen?</p></li>
  					<li><p>the cards are the queen of hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades in that order?</p></li>
  				</ol>
  			</p>
  		</statement>
  		<solution>
  			<p>Notice that nothing is said about the order in which cards are drawn for the first three events.  So we will use <xref ref="thm_counting-rule_combination" text="custom">combinations</xref> to count both the sample space and the number of outcomes in these events.  The common sample space is found by couting the number of ways to select 4 of the 10 cards if order doesn&apos;t matter: <m>C(10,4) = \frac{10 \times 9\times 8\times 7}{4\times 3\times 2\times 1} = 210</m>.
  			<ol label="a">
  				<li><p>If none of the cards are aces, then all four are selected from the remaining 8 non-ace cards. This can be done in <m>C(8,4) = 70</m> ways. So, <m>P(\text{no aces}) = \frac{70}{210} = \frac{1}{3}</m>.</p></li>
  				<li><p>We first split the cards into black and red. There are two black aces and two black queens making 4 total black cards. There are two red kings, two red queens, and two red jacks making 6 red cards. Next we must pick 2 of the 4 black cards and 2 of the 6 red cards. This is a multi-step process, so using the multiplication rule: 
  					<md>
  						<mrow>n(\text{2 black and 2 red}) \amp = n(\text{2 black}) \times n(\text{2 red})</mrow>
  						<mrow>\amp = C(4,2) \times C(6,2)</mrow>
  						<mrow>\amp = 6 \times 15</mrow>
  						<mrow>\amp = 90.</mrow>
  					</md>
  				Thus, <m>P(\text{ 2 black and 2 red }) = \frac{90}{210} = \frac{3}{7}</m>.</p></li>
  				<li><p><q>At least one queen</q> means we could have one queen, two queens, three queens, or all four queens. If we try to count this directly, we must count these four separate cases and then use the addition rule to add them together. Instead, let&apos;s take a short-cut. The opposite of <q>at least one queen</q> is <q>no queens</q>. If we can find the probability of no queens, then we can use the complement rule to find the probability of at least one queen. If we don&apos;t allow the queens to be chosen, there are only 6 cards available. We can pick our entire hand from these 6 cards in <m>C(6,4) = 15</m> ways. So, <m>P(\text{no queens}) = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14}</m>. Therefore,
  				<me>P(\text{at least one queen}) = 1 - P(\text{no queens}) = 1-\frac{1}{14} = \frac{13}{14}.</me></p></li>
  				<li><p>Our last event is different from the other three because the order in which we pick our cards matters.  We should therefore use a <xref ref="thm_counting-rule_permutation" text="custom">permutation</xref> or the <xref ref="thm_counting-rule_multiplication" text="custom">multiplication rule</xref> instead of a combination. Keeping in mind that there is only one of each suite&apos;s queen in the deck, we compute

			<title>Computing Probabilities with Cases</title>
			<statement>
				<p>An experiment consists of randomly selecting three marbles from an urn containing six red marbles, four white marbles, and two green marbles. What is the probability that:
					<ol label="a">
						<li><p>All three marbles are green?</p></li>
						<li><p>All three marbles are white?</p></li>
						<li><p>All three marbles are of the same color?</p></li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>We start by counting the sample space, which will be the same for all three events. We are drawing three marbles from an urn containing 12 total marbles. We don't care about the order in which we draw the marbles, just the colors that are drawn. Therefore, <m>n(S) = C(12,3) = 220</m>.
				  <ol label="a">
				  	<li><p>Since there are only two green marbles, it is impossible for all three of the marbles we draw to be green. Therefore, <m>P(\text{all three are green}) = 0</m>.</p></li>
				  	<li><p>There are four white marbles. The number of ways we can draw three of the four is <m>C(4,3) = 4</m>. Therefore, <m>P(\text{all three are white}) = \frac{4}{220} = \frac{1}{55}</m>.</p></li>
				  	<li><p>All three marbles can be the same color by being all green, all white, or all red. We said that <m>P(\text{all green}) = 0</m> and <m>P(\text{all white}) = \frac{1}{55}</m>. To determine the probability they are all red, we count <m>n(\text{all three red}) = C(6,3) = 20</m>. Thus, <m>P(\text{all red}) = \frac{20}{220} = \frac{1}{11}</m>.</p>
				  	  <p>Now since these are three different ways that we can get all three marbles to be the same color, and since each of these events is mutually exclusive (we can&apos;t get all three red and all three white), we use the general addition rule to get:
				  	  <md>
				  	  	<mrow>P(\text{all same color}) \amp = P(\text{all green}) + P(\text{all white}) + P(\text{all red} )</mrow>
				  	  	<mrow>\amp = 0 + \frac{4}{220} + \frac{20}{220} = \frac{24}{220}</mrow>
				  	  	<mrow>\amp = \frac{6}{55}.</mrow>
				  	  </md>
