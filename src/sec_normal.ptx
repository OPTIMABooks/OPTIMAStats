  	<title>Continuous Distributions</title>
  	<p>The random variables and probability distributions we have looked at thus far have all been <xref ref="def_discrete" text="custom">discrete</xref>. In this section, we introduce <xref ref="def_continuous" text="custom">continuous</xref> random variables. Recall that a continuous variable can take on any possible value in a range of values. That is, there are infinitely many values that the variable could have, and there are no gaps between those values.</p>
  	<p>The way that probability works with continuous random variables can be strange. The probability of any particular value of the variable is always going to be 0. To get non-zero probabilities, we must look at a range of possible values for the variable. To better understand this concept, suppose that a random variable <m>X</m> is defined to be the height, in feet, of a randomly selected person in the city of Seattle. What is <m>P(X=6)</m>? In other words, what is the chance that a randomly selected person will be exactly 6 feet tall?</p>
  	<p>If you are being picky, you will have to say the probability is zero. This is because nobody is exactly 6 feet tall. You can&apos;t be exactly six feet tall down to the atom. Instead, you can say that you are within less than <m>\frac{1}{32}</m>nd of an inch of 6 feet tall, or in some similar tiny range around the exact 6 foot height.</p>
  	<p>We will start our exploration of continuous random variables and probability distributions by looking at the <term>continuous uniform distribution</term>, or just the uniform distribution. Most of our time in this section will, however, be spent introducing the <term>normal distribution</term>. The normal distribution is probably the most important distribution you will see in this text, and is certainly one of the most common in every day life.</p>

		<title>Uniform Distribution</title>
		<p>When dealing with discrete distributions and histograms, we were reminded of the special role that the area principle plays in probability graphs. That is, the area of a given bar in those graphs was exactly equal to the probability of the outcome associated with that bar. This principal holds true with continuous probability distributions as well. In the case of a continuous variable, however, we no longer have a histogram, but instead a smooth (and continuous for those of you who have seen Calculus) curve called a <term>density curve</term>.</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_density-curve">
		  <idx>probability density curve</idx>
		  <idx><h>probability</h><h>density curve</h></idx>
		  <statement>
		  	<p>The <term>probability density</term> curve for a random variable <m>X</m> is a graph in which the possible values of <m>X</m> are listed as a continuous range on the horizontal axis, and the area in a range of <m>X</m> values and below the curve corresponds to the probability that <m>X</m> takes on one of those values.</p>
		  </statement>
		</definition>
		<p>There are certain things that all probability density curves have in common.</p>
		<principle xml:id="def_density-curve-properties">
		  <title>Properties of Probability Density Curves</title>
		  <statement>
		  	<p>Any probability density curve for a continuous random variable <m>X</m> will have the following properties.
		  	  <ul>
		  	  	<li><p>The density curve is represented by a smooth curve</p></li>
		  	  	<li><p>The total area under the curve is 1</p></li>
		  	  	<li><p><m>P(a \lt X \lt b)</m> is the area between the vertical lines <m>X=a</m> and <m>X=b</m> and below the curve.</p></li>

		  	  </ul>
		  	</p>
		  </statement>
		</principle>
	  <p>To better understand this connection between area and probability, we will briefly examine one of the simplest probability distributions for a continuous random variable.</p>
	  <definition xml:id="def_continuous-uniform">
	  	<idx>uniform distribution (continuous)</idx>
	  	<idx><h>probability</h><h>distributions</h><h>continuous uniform</h></idx>
	  	<statement>
	  		<p>A continuous random variable <m>X</m> has a <term>uniform distribution</term>, and is called a <term>uniform random variable</term>, if the probability of <m>X</m> is spread evenly within the range of possible values of <m>X</m>.</p>
	  	</statement>
	  </definition>
	  <p>Graphs are an excellent tool for helping us understand continuous probability distributions. In the example below, and in those that follow, we will always start with a graph of the distribution and mark the regions containing the outcomes in which we are interested.</p>
	  <example xml:id="examp_normal_uniform">
	  	<title>Finding Probabilities in a Uniform Distribution</title>
	  	<statement>
	  		<p>A random variable <m>X</m> has a uniform distribution with possible values between 5 and 10. Sketch a graph of the probability density curve, and use this graph to find the probability that:
	  		  <ol label="a">
	  		  	<li><p>X is between 7 and 8</p></li>
	  		  	<li><p>X is greater than 8.5</p></li>
	  		  </ol>
	  		</p>
	  	</statement>
	  	<solution>
	  		<p>We start by drawing a graph of the density curve for <m>X</m>. Because the distribution is uniform, this means the curve will be a horizontal line above the range of possible values of <m>X</m>, which is from 5 to 10. Since the area under the curve must equal the probability and the probability that <m>X</m> is between 5 and 10 is 1 (this is the sample space because all possible values of <m>X</m> are between 5 and 10), we must make the height <m>h</m> the number for which <m>h \times (10-5) = 1</m>. That means, <m>h \times 5 = 1</m>, so <m>h = \frac{1}{5}</m>. This yields the first graph.</p>

		<p>Now that we know what a normal distribution looks like, it should be easy to use the picture to find probabilities. After all, the probability that <m>X</m> is between two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>is simply the area in  that range. Consider the following example.</p>

		<p>The problem with the above strategy is that the blue region, whose area is the probability we need to find, is not a simple region. That is, it is not a rectangle like was the case in the uniform distribution. It is not even a triangle, circle, or other object that we can easily find the area of. In fact, if we want to find the exact area of this region, we would need to make use of the following formula, in which <m>\mu</m> is the mean and <m>\sigma</m> is the standard deviation of the variable <m>X</m>.
		  <me>f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}</me>
		</p>
		<p>This formula gives the height of the curve at a particular value of <m>x</m>.  To actually use this formula to find the area above, we would need to use calculus, which is beyond the scope of this course. We therefore take another approach. We instead use tables for a single normal distribution, and convert all other normal distributions to that one <term>standard normal distribution</term>.</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_standard-normal-dist">
			<idx>standard normal distribution</idx>
			<idx><h>probability</h><h>distributions</h><h>standard normal</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>The <term>standard normal distribution</term> is the normal distribution with mean <m>\mu = 0</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma = 1</m>. We use the random variable <m>Z</m> to represent values taken from the standard normal distribution.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>We have actually already used the standard normal distribution to some extent. Values of a standard normal random variable <m>Z</m> are called <xref ref="def_z-score" text="custom">z-scores</xref>. These same z-scores were used in <xref ref="sec_relative-standing"/> to help measure relative standing<mdash/>that is, where a value lies relative to the mean and standard deviation of a data set. The standard normal distribution has the same properties as any other normal distribution, with these additional properties added to that list.</p>
		<theorem xml:id="thm_standard-normal-properties">
			<title>Properties of the Standard Normal Distribution</title>
			<statement>
				<p>The standard normal distribution has values <m>Z</m> such that:
				  <ul>
				  	<li><p><m>Z</m> is the number of standard deviations away from the mean</p></li>
				  	<li><p>negative z-scores are to the left of the mean</p></li>

		</theorem>
		<p>The advantage to having a standard normal distribution is that the areas which were hard to compute in <xref ref="examp_normal_area-sketch"/> can be computed ahead of time for this single normal distribution and compiled into a table. We can then look up probabilities in that table for regions in the standard normal distribution table. This table is called the standard normal table, and will be useful in many of the problems which follow. The example below shows a reproduction of this table along with an explanation of how to use it.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_normal_table-positive">
			<title>Using the Standard Normal Table with Positive z-Scores</title>

				<p>Use it to find the following probabilities.

						<li><p><m>P(Z \gt 1.24)</m></p></li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>The tables give us the probability of the shaded area in the picture. The left-most column gives the first two digits of the z-score, and the column headers give the second decimal place.
					<ol label="a">
						<li><title><m>P(Z \lt 1.10)</m></title>
						  <p>This is the probability that <m>Z</m> is less than 1.10. To find this we need to look up 1.10 in the table. We go to the 1.10 in the left-most column and then go over to the 0.00 column. The blue lines show these entries. The entry in the blue box is then the probability that <m>Z \lt 1.10</m>. So, our answer is <m>0.8643</m>.</p></li>
						<li><title><m>P(Z \gt 1.24)</m></title>
						  <p>This is the probability that <m>Z</m> is greater than 1.24. We must find this in two steps. First, we find <m>P(Z \lt 1.24)</m> using the table. The red lines show how this is done, by going to the 1.20 entry in the left-most column, and then over to the 0.04 entry in the column headings. The boxed entry, <m>0.8925</m>, is <m>P(Z \lt 1.24)</m>. But we want <m>P(Z \gt 1.24)</m>. This is the complement, so using the complement rule,
						  <me>P(Z \gt 1.24) = 1 - P(Z \lt 1.24) = 1 - 0.8925 = 0.1075</me>.</p></li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>The standard normal distribution table contains two parts. The part used above is used for looking up probabilities associated with positive z-scores. In the next example we see how to use the negative part of this table.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_normal_table-negative">
			<title>Using the Standard Normal Table with Negative z-Scores</title>

				<p><ol label="a">
					<li><title><m>P(Z \lt -1.82)</m></title>
					  <p>The probability that <m>Z</m> is less than -1.82 can be found by looking up -1.8 row, and then going over to the 0.02 column. The red lines in the table above show this computation. The boxed probability gives <m>P(Z \lt -1.82) = 0.0344</m>.</p></li>
					<li><title><m>P(Z \gt -1.68)</m></title>
					  <p>The blue lines in the table above show how the probability 0.0465 is found. Note, however, that this is the probability that <m>Z \lt -1.68</m>. To get the probability that <m>Z</m> is greater than -1.68, we again use the complement rule to get:
					  <me>P(Z \gt -1.68) = 1 - P(Z \lt - 1.68) = 1 - 0.0465 = 0.9535</me>.</p></li>
				</ol></p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>Finally, there are times when we wish to find the probability that <m>Z</m> is between two values. In those cases, we look up the probabilities of being below the two endpoints of our range and then subtract to find the probability in the middle.  It is usually a good idea to sketch a picture to help us keep track of the various areas involved in a problem like the one shown below.</p>

				<p>Now, according to the positive standard normal distribution table, <m>P(Z \lt 1.24) = 0.8925</m>.

		<title>Other Normal Distributions</title>
		<p>As we saw earlier, there are many different normal distributions. Our goal now is to learn how all of those can be modeled using the standard normal distribution table. To do this, we make use of <xref ref="def_z-score" text="custom">z-scores</xref>. We incorporate this definition into the following principle for converting from any normal dikstribution to the standard normal distribution.</p>

		<title>Reverse Look-up</title>
		<p>So far we have used the standard normal distribution table to look up probabilities based on a given z-score. We can, however, also use this table in reverse. Consider the following example.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_normal-reverse">
			<title>Using the Standard Normal Distribution Table in Reverse</title>
			<statement>
				<p>Use the standard normal distribution table to find the z-score that separates:
					<ol label="a">
						<li><p>The bottom 80% of data from the top 20% of data in a normal distribution.</p></li>
						<li><p>The middle 68% of data from the rest of the data in a normal distribution.</p></li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>Since we are using the table in reverse, we will look in the body of the table for the given probability, and find the z-scores in the row and column headings.
					<ol label="a">
						<li><p>The bottom 80% of data in a normal distribution would have probability 0.8000, as shown in the picture below.</p>

		<p>At first, this may not seem terribly useful. However, it can be a very useful tool in real-world problems. We will use this reverse look-up technique extensively in inferential statistics in the second part of this text. We can also use it in applied problems such as the following.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_normal-reverse-application">
		  <title>Solving an Application Problem Using the Standard Normal Distribution Table in Reverse</title>
		  <statement>
		  	<p>A mathematics professor at a large university gives an exam to 186 students. She decides that she will give A&apos;s on the final exam to those who scored in the top 10% of the class, and B&apos;s to those who scored in the top 25%. If the final exam scores had a normal distribution with mean <m>\mu = 65.3</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma = 11.6</m>, What was the lowest score on the exam that earned an A, and what was the lowest score for a B?</p>
		  </statement>
		  <solution>
		  	<p>We will first determine the z-scores that separate the A&apos;s and B&apos;s from the rest of the grades, and then turn those z-scores into exam scores.  The image below will serve as our guide.</p>

		  	  <ul>
		  	    <li><p>The top 10% of the class will get A&apos;s, meaning the bottom 90% will not. Therefore, we are looking for the z-score that separates the bottom 90% from the top 10%. Looking for 0.9000 in the table, the closest we find is 0.8997, which goes with a z-score of <m>z_A=1.28</m>.</p></li>
		  	    <li><p>The top 25% will be separated by the z-score which has probability 0.7500 in the table. The closest probability is 0.7486. The associated z-score is <m>z_B=0.67</m>.</p></li>
		  	  </ul>
		  	  Now we need to turn these z-scores back into exam scores. That means we need to use the z-score formula in reverse. This yields, for A&apos;s, the following.
		  	  <me>1.28 = \frac{x - 65.3}{11.6} \Rightarrow 1.28(11.6) = x - 65.3 \Rightarrow 14.848 + 65.3 = x \Rightarrow x = 80.14</me>.
		  	  It appears that those with a score of 80.14 or better will get A&apos;s. In practical terms, this probably means you need to score 80.5 or 81 to get an A, depending on if the professor gives half points.</p>
		  	<p>For B&apos;s, we repeat the above using the z-score 0.67. 
		  	  <me>0.67 = \frac{x - 65.3}{11.6} \Rightarrow 0.67(11.6) = x - 65.3 \Rightarrow 7.772 + 65.3 = x \Rightarrow x = 73.072</me>.
		  	</p>
		  	<p>So a student needs to score between 73.072 and 80.14 to get a B.</p>
