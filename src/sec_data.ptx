		<title>What is Data?</title>

		<introduction xml:id="sec_data_variables_intro">
			<p>Statistics is the study of <term>data</term>. So it is vitally important that we understand what data is. Throughout this text we need to be sure that we all agree on what terms mean. Whenever we introduce a new term, it will be defined as follows.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_data">
				<idx>data</idx>
				<statement>
					<p>Any collection of measurements or values is referred to collectively as <term>data</term>.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>We can understand and classify data better if we first understand the source from which the measurements are taken. Each type of measurement such as height, length of time, or favorite pizza topping, comes from a certain characteristic or property called a	<term>variable</term>.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_variable">
				<idx>variable</idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>variable</term> is a single characteristic that is being measured or changed.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>In a typical set of data, one or more variables are identified, and the measurements are collected for each of those variables.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_data_identifying-variables">
				<title>Identifying Variables</title>

				<solution>
					<p>The three characteristics measured are: fish species, fish length, and fish weight. These are the variables.</p>

		<subsubsection xml:id="sec_data_variables_number">
			<title>Classification by Number of Variables</title>
			<p>One way in which we can classify data is based on the number of variables that are being measured. In this class we will look at data sets composed of	measurements from one, two, or more variables. These are given the following names.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_num-vars">
				<idx><h>data</h><h>univariate</h></idx>
				<idx><h>data</h><h>bivariate</h></idx>
				<idx><h>data</h><h>multivariate</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A data set can be named based on the number of variables being measured as follows.
						<ul>
							<li><p><term>Univariate data</term> contains measurements from a single variable.</p></li>
							<li><p><term>Bivariate data</term> contains measurements from two variables. This is sometimes called <term>paired data</term></p></li>
							<li><p><term>Multivariate data</term> contains measurements from three or more variables.</p></li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>Let&apos;s look at an example.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_data_classifying-datasets">
				<title>Classifying Datasets</title>
				<statement>
					<p>Identify each of the following data sets based on the number of variables being measured.

				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						<ol>
							<li><p>Multivariate - there are three variables: species, length, and weight.</p></li>
							<li><p>Univariate - since there is only one variable, height, this is univariate data.</p></li>
							<li><p>Bivariate - collecting age and support for the bond means that there are two variables.</p></li>

		<subsubsection xml:id="sec_data_variables_type">
			<title>Types of Variable</title>
			<p>Another way to classify data is based on the types of variables that are being measured. The type of a variable depends on what is being recorded. Consider the following example.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_data_classify-variables">
				<title>Classifying Variables</title>
				<statement>
					<p> The post office, wishing to better understand its customers, decides to collect	data from 1000 households within a certain state. They mail each household a questionnaire asking the residents to confirm their zip code, list the number of people who live in that household, and give the length of time that they have lived there. What are the variables in this study, and how do the measurements differ?</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>The three variables in this multivariate set of data are: zip code, number of residents, and length of time in residence. The characteristics of these variables are:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<title>Zip Code</title>
								<p>
									While the values recorded are numbers (i.e. 99324, 49103, 92357, etc) they
									actually represent categories and not numerical values. Notice that it would 
									make no sense to <q>average</q> two zip codes!
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<title>Number of Residents</title>
								<p>These values are numbers (i.e. 2 residents, 5 residents, 1 resident, etc) and they do actually represent numerical quantities. Notice that it does make sense to talk about the <q>average number of residents.</q> Also, note that the values that this variable can take on are all whole numbers. In particular, there are <q>gaps</q> between the values (i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc.).</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<title>Length of Residence</title>
								<p>The values for this final variable are also numbers (i.e. 1 year, 2 months, and 12 days = 1.2 years). These numbers do make sense in an average, and they also are different from the number of residents values because there is no space in between them.  In other words, if I&apos;ve lived at my house for 0.9 years, and you&apos;ve lived at yours for 1.0 years, then there is still room <q>in between</q> those two values for somebody who has lived that their residence for 0.97 years.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</solution>
			</example>
			<p>This example helps point out the three types of variables that we will be studying. The first type, zip code, is an example of a variable that really yields non-numerical data. The values of such a variable represent categories into which the individuals can be grouped, or in other words a <q>quality</q> instead of a <q>quantity.</q></p>
			<definition xml:id="def_qualitative-variable">
				<idx>qualitative variable</idx>
				<idx><h>variable</h><h>qualitative</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>qualitative variable</term> (also called a <term>categorical variable</term>) is one that takes on values representing categories or descriptions as opposed to numerical values.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>In this text we will spend the majority of our time working with variables whose values are numbers that can be added, divided, etc. These types of values represent a quantity as opposed to a quality, and they are named accordingly.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_quantitative-variable">
				<idx>quantitative variable</idx>
				<idx><h>variable</h><h>quantitative</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>quantitative variable</term> is one that takes on numerical values. Unlike a qualitative variable, the values of a quantitative variable can be used in computations.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p> In our example we saw that even though Number of Residents and Length of Residence are both quantitative variables, the measurements we take are still somewhat different.  Because of these  differences, we need two more definitions that apply only to quantitative variables.</p>	
			<definition xml:id="def_discrete">
				<idx>discrete variable</idx>
				<idx><h>variable</h><h>quantitative</h><h>discrete</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>discrete variable</term> is a quantitative variable in which there are gaps between the possible values of the variable.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<definition xml:id="def_continuous">
				<idx>continuous variable</idx>
				<idx><h>variable</h><h>quantitative</h><h>continuous</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>continuous variable</term> is a quantitative variable for which there are an infinite number of possible values with no gaps between these values.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>Before we move on, let&apos;s revisit the example above and give the formal types of each of the three variables.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_data_classify-variables-2">
				<title>Classifying Variables, Revisited</title>
				<statement>
					<p>The post office, wishing to better understand its customers, decides to collect data from 1000 ouseholds within a certain state. They mail each household a questionnaire sking the esidents to confirm their zip code, list the number of people who live in that husehold, and give the length of time that they have lived there. Identify and classify each of the variables in this survey.</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>The three variables in this multivariate set are:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<title>Zip Code</title>
								<p>qualitative variable</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<title>Number of Residents</title>
								<p>quantitative and discrete variable</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<title>Length of Residence</title>
								<p>quantitative and continuous variable</p>
							</li>

		<title>Collecting Data</title>

		<introduction xml:id="sec_data_collecting_intro">
			<p>Before we even have data to analyze or describe, we must first collect the	data.</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection xml:id="sec_data_collecting_type">
			<title>Populations and Samples</title>
			<p>The process we use to collect data is just as important, if not more important, than the tools we use to analyze that data. Consider the following example.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_data_representative-data">
				<title>Representative Data</title>
				<statement>
					<p>Sam the high school student, who has not had a statistics class, decides to do a research project on the height of an average student at his school. Since he works for the basketball coach, Sam decides to look up the heights of all students who have played for the basketball team over the last 10 years.	How useful will this data be for Sam&apos;s research project?</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>This data will be of no use in researching the height of an average high school student. The data was collected from a small group of students who will, in general, be much taller than the typical high school student.</p>
				</solution>
			</example>
			<p>Our analysis of a set of data will do us no good if that data does not come from the objects that we are trying to study. To better understand this concept, we need to first distinguish between the subjects we are trying	to study, and the individuals from whom we actually collect data.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_population">
				<idx>population</idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>population</term> is the collection of all subjects to be studied.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<definition xml:id="def_sample">
				<idx>sample</idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>sample</term> is a sub-collection of subjects drawn from a given population.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>Using these new terms, the problem with Sam&apos;s research is that the sample he selected is not representative of the population he is studying. One way to remedy this problem would be to collect the height of all students at Sam&apos;s school. That is, he could measure the entire population.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_census">
				<idx>census</idx>
				<statement>
					<p>In a <term>census</term>, data is collected from every member of the population being studied.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>However, if Sam attends a large high school, taking a census may not be possible. If we think of other examples, we soon come to the realization that in many instances the population being studied is either too large or it is too expensive for us to collect data from every member of the population. In those cases, we must carefully select a sample that is representative of our population.</p>

		<subsubsection xml:id="sec_data_collecting_plans">
			<title>Sampling Plans</title>
			<p>Since it is important that we select a sample that represents the population we are studying, we need to be very careful when selecting a sample. We not only need to guard against accidentally designing a sample that does not represent the population, but also against unintentional bias in the way we collect our data. One of the best tools in guarding against such biased samples is randomness, and the simplest way to use randomness to collect a sample is to collect a <term>simple random sample</term>.</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_simple-random-sample">
				<idx><h>sample</h><h>simple random sample</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>simple random sample</term> of size <m>n</m> is a sample drawn from a population in such a way that every group of <m>n</m> subjects in the population is equally likely to be chosen.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>To better understand the concept of a simple random sample, consider the following example.</p>
			<example xml:id="examp_data_sample-plans-1">
				<title>Simple Random Samples</title>
				<statement>
					<p>A professor wishes to randomly select a sample of 6 students from her class of 48. The students are sitting in eight rows of six students each. The professor comes up with two sampling methods.
						<ol>
							<li><p>Assign each student a number from 1 to 48, and then write these numbers on slips of paper, put them in a bag, and randomly select six of these slips to determine which students will be included in the sample.</p></li>
							<li><p>Assign each row of students a random number from 1 to 8. Then randomly select one number and include all six of the students in that row in the sample.</p></li>
						</ol>
						Which of these two methods will result in a simple random sample?</p>
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>The key to solving this problem is deciding if using a particular method give each group of six students the same chance of being chosen.
							<ol>
								<li><p>This method is a simple random sample. Each group of six students has the same chance of being chosen (we&apos;ll see how to compute this when we study probability).</p></li>
								<li><p>This method is not a simple random sample. To see this, suppose that Bob is sitting in row 1 and Mary in row 2. Then it is impossible for Bob and Mary to be chosen in the same sample. This means that any group including both Bob and Mary has no chance of being chosen, and therefore all groups of six are not equally likely.</p></li>
							</ol>
						</p>
					</solution>
				</example>
				<p>Ensuring that we get a simple random sample can be difficult. Even if we manage to design a simple random sample, we still can not be certain that we will get a sample that is representative of the population we are studying. There are several alternative sampling techniques that can help us select a representative sample, and at the same time make it easier to select our sample. Each of these methods employs randomness. However, none of them will result in a true simple random sample.</p>

				<title>Types of Studies</title>
				<p>A sample may be collected from a population for one of two reasons. We may simply wish to know a characteristic of that population. On the other hand, we may want to try to change a characteristic and then measure the result. These result in two different types	of studies.</p>
				<definition xml:id="def_observational-study">
					<idx>observational study</idx>
					<idx><h>study types</h><h>observational</h></idx>
					<statement>
						<p>In an <term>observational study</term> specific characteristics are observed and measured, but no attempt is made to change these characteristics.</p>
					</statement>
				</definition>
				<definition xml:id="def_experiment">
					<idx>experiment</idx>
					<idx><h>study types</h><h>experiment</h></idx>
					<statement>
						<p>In an <term>experiment</term>, some treatment is applied and its effects on the subject are observed.</p>
					</statement>
				</definition>
				<p>Notice that the main difference is that in an experiment we attempt to change a characteristic whereas in an observational study, we do not. Because experiments seek to measure the effect of a treatment on the subject, they are by nature more complicated than observational studies. Below are some specific terms used when designing an experiment.</p>
				<definition xml:id="def_experiment-terms">
					<idx>factor</idx>
					<idx>treatment</idx>
					<idx><h>study types</h><h>experiment</h><h>factor</h></idx>
					<idx><h>study types</h><h>experiment</h><h>treatment</h></idx>
					<statement>
						<p>When conducting an experiment, the following terms are often used.
							<ul>
								<li><p>A <term>factor</term> is an independent variable the values of which are varied by the experimenter.</p></li>
								<li><p>A <term>treatment</term> is a specific combination of factor values.</p></li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</statement>
				</definition>
				<p>To help see the difference between these two types of studies, let&apos;s look at a couple of examples.</p>
				<example xml:id="examp_data_study-type-1">
					<title>Types of Studies</title>
					<statement>
						<p>Sam wishes to determine the length of time that it takes a radish seed to germinate. He plants radishes in his garden, and continues his normal watering and weeding process. When the first radish sprouts emerge, Sam records the length of time that has elapsed. Is Sam conducting an observational study or an experiment?
						</p>
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>In this case, Sam is conducting an observational study. He does not attempt to change the conditions under which the seeds are growing, he simply observes the length of time it took sprouts to emerge.</p>
					</solution>
				</example>
				<example xml:id="examp_data_study-type-2">

						<p>Nancy is more ambitions than Sam. She wants to know if radish seeds can be made to germinate faster by altering the conditions in which they grow. To test this theory, Nancy decides that she will plant four groups of radish seeds. The first group will be watered and weeded as normal. The second group will be watered and weeded as well, but will in addition receive fertilizer every other day. The third group will be weeded as normal, but will receive twice as much water. Finally, the fourth group of radish seeds will be weeded as normal, receive fertilizer every other day, and get twice as much water. Nancy will record how long it takes each group of radish seeds to sprout. Is this an observational study or an experiment?</p>
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>Nancy is conducting an experiment. By altering the environment of the radish seeds, she is varying the treatment that each group of seeds receives and then measuring the	effects. The two factors that Nancy is varying are amount of water and fertilization. The treatments are represented by the four groups:
							<ul>
								<li><p>normal water, no fertilizer</p></li>
								<li><p>normal water, fertilizer</p></li>
								<li><p>double water, no fertilizer</p></li>

				<paragraphs xml:id="sec_data_collecting_avoid-bad-samples">
					<title>Bad Samples</title>
					<p>If we use a sampling technique that does not include some element of randomness we are likely to produce a sample that does not represent our population. One of the easiest, but most dangerous ways to collect data is by using a convenience sample.</p>

							<p>A <term>convenience sample</term> is a sample collected by simply selecting the most convenient members of a population.</p>

					<definition xml:id="def_bias">
						<idx>bias</idx>
						<statement>
							<p>A sample has <term>bias</term> and is called <term>biased</term> if it over-represents one portion of a population and under-represents another.</p>

						</statement>
						<solution>
							<p>Your sample is not representative of the entire population of Americans. By selecting a convenience sample (your family) you have chosen individuals who are likely to have similar preferences--after all, you all grew up with more cake than pie. This is a source of bias in your sample.</p>

				<paragraphs xml:id="sec_data_collecting_avoid-leading-questions">
					<title>Leading Questions</title>

Some questions, however, are intentionally worded to evoke a specific response.</p>

				<paragraphs xml:id="sec_data_collecting_avoid-lurking-variables">
					<title>Lurking Variables</title>
					<p>One of the most prevalent things to avoid when using statistics is assuming that because there is a <term>correlation</term> between two things, one must cause the other. In many cases there can be a third (or forth, or fifth) unknown variable that <q>lurks</q> in the background and is affecting both observed variables. Let&apos;s define these terms precisely and finish with an example.</p>
					<definition xml:id="def_correlation">
						<idx>correlation</idx>
						<statement>
							<p>We say that there is <term>correlation</term> between two (or more) variables if certain values of one frequently appear together with certain values of the other.</p>
						</statement>
					</definition>
					<p>For example, we would say that there is a correlation between people&apos;s height and weight because taller people tend to weigh more. But does being taller cause you to weigh more, or do they just go together?</p>
					<definition xml:id="def_causation">
						<idx>causation</idx>
						<statement>
							<p>We say that there is <term>causation</term> between two variables if the value of one of the variables causes the value of the other to change.</p>
						</statement>
					</definition>
					<p>To understand this term, suppose that we measured the variables <q>average driving speed</q> and <q>number of speeding tickets.</q> It would be reasonable to say that there is causation between these two variables. That is, driving faster causes one to get more speeding tickets. But it is possible that there is another variable affecting both your driving speed and number of tickets. Suppose, for example, that you drive a fancy red sports car. This is a potential example of a <term>lurking variable</term>.</p>
					<definition xml:id="def_lurking-variable">
						<idx>lurking variable</idx>
						<idx><h>variable</h><h>lurking</h></idx>
						<statement>
							<p>A lurking variable is an unmeasured variable that has an important effect on the relationship between variables in a study.</p>
						</statement>
					</definition>
					<p>Consider the following examples.</p>
					<example xml:id="examp_data_lurking-variables-1">
						<title>Luring Variables</title>
						<statement>
							<p>In a study of fuel efficiency and its relationship to weight the Buick Estate Wagon appeared to be an anomaly.

Further research indicated that Buick&apos;s recommended a higher tire inflation pressure than did the other car manufacturers. Identify the lurking variable in this study.</p>
						</statement>
						<solution>
							<p>Tire Pressure is the lurking variable. While it has an effect on gas mileage (higher pressure = better mileage) it was not included in the original study.</p>

					</example>
					<example xml:id="examp_data_lurking-variables-2">
						<title>Lurking Variables</title>
						<statement>
							<p>A study of nutrition and TV ownership in Africa found that there was a high correlation between a family suffering from malnutrition and not owning a television set. A statistics student concludes that there is causation as well. That is, owning a television set leads to better nutrition. Critique	this conclusion.</p>
						</statement>
						<solution>
							<p>The student is confusing causation and correlation. While there may be correlation between owning a television and having good nutrition, it is not logical to conclude that having a TV improves nutrition. It is much more reasonable to conclude that there is a lurking variable in this study. Perhaps the economic status of the families studied is causing both the differences in	nutrition and television ownership.</p>

					<statement>
						<p>A major department store wishes to determine if people with store credit cards enjoy their shopping experience more than those who do not have store credit cards. To research this question, they send surveys to everybody who has shopped at their store in the last year and ask them if they enjoyed their shopping experience, and if they have a store card. They find that the majority of returned surveys are from people who either have a card and enjoyed their shopping experience, or from people who do not have a card and didn&apos;t enjoy their shopping experience. The store concludes that having a store card makes shopping with the store more enjoyable.</p>
