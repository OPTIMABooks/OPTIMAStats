  <title>Understanding Randomness and Probability</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>Randomness is essential to the study of statistics for many different reasons.  Two of the most important are stated below.
      <ul>
        <li><p>By using randomness we can design samples that have a better chance of being non-biased and representing the population.</p></li>
        <li><p>By understanding randomness, we can use our sample not only to make a claim about a population, or estimate the value of a population parameter, but also to state how <q>good</q> that claim is.</p></li>
      </ul>
      Since inferential statistics, which is where we are headed in this text, is all about making claims about a population based on a sample, it is important that we understand randomness and more specifically, the probability of an event.</p>
