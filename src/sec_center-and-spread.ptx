  <title>Describing Data Numerically: Measures of Center and Spread</title>

  <subsection>
	<title>Introduction</title>
	<p>
	  While describing data sets using graphs gives a good overview, it does not give
	  us the detail that we need to do more advanced analysis. Graphs are meant to give
	  a picture of the data, but in order to make decisions based on a set of data, we 
	  need to have numerical summaries.
	</p>
	<p>
      In this section, we will look at several types of numerical summaries, or
	  measures, which we can compute from a set of quantitative data. These types
	  of measures include the following.
	  <ol>
	  	<li><p>
	  	  <title>Measures of Center</title>
	  	  A measure of center gives a single number that represents the "typical" value
	  	  in the set of data. One very familiar measure of center is the average. When 
	  	  you say that the average score on an exam is 80%, you are claiming that the 
	  	  typical student scored 80%. This is not, however, the only way to measure 
	  	  the center of a data set, as we shall see in this section.
	  	</p></li>
	  	<li><p>
	      <title>Measures of Spread</title>
	      Also called a measure of variation, this number or set of numbers indicates how
	      spread out the data is. For example, if three students take an exam and all 
	      score 80%, the average would be 80%, but there is no variation between the
	      scores. But if three students scored 60%, 80%, and 100%, the average would
	      still be 80%, but now there is a large amount of variation between their 
	      scores<emdash/>they are much more spread out.
	    </p></li>
	  </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
	  Each of these values can be computed for data drawn from a sample (a small number 
	  of values from a larger population), or for a census of an entire population. 
	  We give them different names, however, depending on the source.

	</p>

	<p>
	  The measures of center that we will look at often come with a related measure
	  of variation, so we will examine these together where appropriate.

Mode
<idx>><h>mode</h></data>
We have already seen the term "mode" used in the context of a graph. Recall
that the mode of a
histogram or bar graph is the class or category that has the tallest bar. That
is, it is the class or
category that appears the most in the data set. This seems to be a reasonable
way to describe a
"typical" element of a data set.
Mode
The mode of a set of values is the value that appears most often. If more than
one value is tied
for the most appearances, each one is a mode. If no value appears more than
once, there is no
mode.
The mode is unique among our measures of center as it is the only one that
applies to both
quantitative variables and qualitative variables. Consider the following
examples.
Example 1.3.1
A breakout presentation at a business convention attracts 16 participants. The
job title of each of
these participants is as follows. Find the mode of this set of data.
manager owner
H.R. director
owner
manager H.R. director
manager
manager
owner manager
manager
H.R. director
manager owner
owner
manager
Solution
The mode is the most commonly appearing value. In this set of data, the values
are manager (8
times), owner (5 times) and H.R. directory (3 times). So the mode is "manager".
Example 1.3.2
A survey of 12 grocery store shoppers asked how many times a month these
shoppers visit their
favorite grocery store. Find the mode of the resulting data, shown below.

2
5

3

6

8
Solution
Notice that in this data set, both the 5 and the 3 appear three times. Every
other value appears
two or fewer times. This makes this set of data bimodal with modes 3 and 5.
While the mode is an easy way to measure the center, and is in fact the only
way we have to
measure the center of a set of qualitative data, it is usually not the best
choice for measuring the
center of a set of quantitative data. To see why this may be so, consider the
next example.
Example 1.3.3
Find the mode of the following sets of numbers.
(a): { 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, 19, 22, 50 }
(b): { 1, 1, 20, 23, 26, 24, 29, 30, 27, 32, 19 }
Solution
The modes of these sets of numbers are as follows:
1.The set (a) contains no repeated values. Therefore, according to the
definition, there is
no mode for this set.
2.The set (b) contains only one repeated value, 1. So the mode is 1. However, 1
is
definitely not the "typical" value in the set since all other values are
between 19 and 32.
In summary, you should use the mode to measure the center of any qualitative
set of data, or as a
quick, but not definitive, measure of center for quantitative data. But be
careful! The mode may not
exist, there may be multiple modes, and if there is a single mode it may be
very different from the
"typical" values in the data set.

Midrange and Range
When we think of the "typical" value in a set of data, we may also think of the
word "middle." Our
next measure of center is exactly that--the middle of the data set.
Midrange
The midrange  of a set of data is the value in the exact center of the data. To
compute the
midrange, use the formula:
\(\text{midrange} = \frac{\text{maximum} + \text{minimum}}{2}\)
where "maximum" is the maximum value in the data set and "minimum" is the
minimum value.
Notice that the midrange does involve some computation using numerical values,
so it can only be
used with quantitative variables--where such computations make sense. To
measure how spread
out the data is from the midrange, we use the range.
Range
The range of a set of data is the difference between the highest and lowest
values in the data
set. That is:
range = maximum - minimum.
Let's try out these new definitions with an example.
Example 1.3.4
A certain pond has been well stocked with fish for the upcoming fishing season.
In order to keep
a fish from this pond, it must be at least 13 inches long. To try to determine
if the fish in the pond
are long enough to allow fishing, a fish and game warden randomly catches and
releases 20
different fish, finding the following lengths, in inches. Find the range and
midrange of this data.

13.1
Solution
To find the midrange and range we need to identify the maximum and minimum
values in the
data set. The largest value is 18.3 and the smallest is 6.5, Thus we compute:
\(\text{midrange} = \frac{18.3+6.5}{2} = 12.4\)
and
\(\text{range} = 18.3 - 6.5 = 11.8.\)
It looks like the pond is not yet ready to open for fishing. The typical fish,
as measured by the
midrange, is only 12.4 inches long and could not be kept.
The midrange and range are useful tools for measuring the center and spread of
a set of data, but
there are several problems with them. The biggest problem is that both the
midrange and range
are extremely sensitive to outliers.
Outlier
An outlier in a data set is a value that is either much larger than the rest of
the data or much
smaller than the rest of the data.
To see how an outlier can affect the midrange and range, let's take another
look at the fish-length
data from the previous example.
Example 1.3.5
The game warden believes that the 6.5 inch fish he caught in the above example
is an outlier.
He decides to redo the computation without that fish. Find the new midrange and
range.
Solution
Without the outlier, the new minimum is 8.7. This gives the following values:
\(\text{midrange} = \frac{18.3+8.7}{2} = 13.5\)
and
\(\text{range} = 18.3 - 8.7 = 9.6.\)
With this new computation, it looks like the fish are in fact large enough to
be caught--the typical
fish length, as measured by the midrange, is 13.5 inches.
Notice what a big difference the single 6.5 inch fish made! This is what we
mean when we say that
the midrange is sensitive to outliers. Another problem with the range and
midrange is that they only
use the extreme maximum and minimum values of the data set. Ideally, we would
want every value
in the set of data to have some part in computing the "typical" value and the
"spread" of the data.
For this reason, we will keep working on developing a better measure of center
and spread.

Median and Quartiles
To reinforce why we need a measure of center that is resistant to outliers,
consider the following
example.
Example 1.3.6
The most expensive house in a certain market is a $2,500,000.00 mansion. The
least expensive
house is an $8,000.00 mobile home. Do you think that the midrange is an
accurate measure of
the "typical" home value in this market?
Solution
To answer this question, let's first compute the midrange. This is:
\(\text{midrange} = \frac{2500000 + 8000}{2} = 1254000.\)
Do you think that the typical house really costs one and a quarter million
dollars? Probably not!
The midrange is not an appropriate measure of center.
Once again, the outliers in this data set are affecting the midrange. To solve
that problem, we will
introduce a new measure of center that is both resistant to outliers (meaning
that they do not affect
it very much) and considers every value in the data set.
Median
The median of a data set is the middle number, or average of the two middle
numbers, in the set
of data once it has been arranged in increasing order.
You may have heard of the median before. It is often used as a measure of
center in data sets
where we expect outliers, such as housing prices. Another common set of data in
which the
median is used is household income. The phrase "median household income" may
sound familiar.
For those of us working in Washington State with Bill Gates, it is a good thing
that the median is
used to measure typical incomes! Let's practice computing the median.
Example 1.3.7
Find the median of each set of data below.
a.{ 14, 17, 10, 9, 16, 19, 12, 10, 15, 13 }
b.{ 100, 215, 164, 117, 1000, 205, 178 }
Solution
There are two steps to computing the median, and it is important that we do
step one first. That
first step is to arrange the data in order. The second step is to locate the
middle value. Let's try
this on both of the data sets above.
a.Our first step is to re-arrange this set of numbers in order, from smallest
to largest:
9, 10, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19
Then we find the middle number. Since there are an even number of values (ten
of
them), the exact middle lies half way between the two center values (5th and
6th) which
are 13 and 14. So the median is (13+14)/2 = 13.5.
b.Again, we start by ordering the data:
100, 117, 164, 178, 205, 215, 1000
As there are an odd number of values in this data set (seven of them), the
median is the
single value in the exact center (the 4th value), which is 178.
Notice that the 1000 in the second data set is a definite outlier. However, in
computing the median,
the actual value does not matter. The only thing that matters is its
relationship to the rest of the
data. This 1000 could be replaced by a more reasonable 220 and the median would
not change.
Bill Gates could make only $200,000 a year, and the median household income in
Washington
State would not change! This is what it means to be resistant to outliers.
To measure the variation in a set of data, we can use a slight twist on the
median. Notice that the
median divides the set of data into two pieces. If we take each of those pieces
and divide them in
half, we are dividing the data into quarters. We can then look at the range
between the first quarter
of the data and the third quarter of the data. This gives us a measurement
similar to the range, but
since we are only looking at the middle half of the data, we will not be
affected by any outliers at
the extremes.
Quartiles
Any quantitative data set can be divided up into quarters using five quartiles.
These quartiles
are:
Q
0
- The zeroth quartile is the minimum value in the data set.
Q
1
- The first quartile divides the bottom quarter of the data from the rest of
the data.
Q
2
- The second quartile divides the bottom half of the data from the top half.
This is
more commonly called the median.
Q
3
- The third quartile divides the bottom three-quarters of the data from the top
quarter.
Q
4
- The fourth quartile is the maximum value in the data set.
The range between the Q1 and Q3 is of particular interest and, as mentioned
above, it has a
special name.
Interquartile Range (IQR)
The Interquartile Range, IQR for short, is the difference between the 3rd and
1st quartiles. That
is,
IQR = Q
3
- Q
1
.
To see how this works, let's revisit the fish-length example from the previous
page.
Example 1.3.8
A certain pond has been well stocked with fish for the upcoming fishing season.
In order to keep
a fish from this pond, it must be at least 13 inches long. To try to determine
if the fish in the pond
are long enough to allow fishing, a fish and game warden randomly catches and
releases 20
different fish, finding the following lengths, in inches. Find the median and
IQR for this data.

13.1
Solution
1.We first arrange the data in order. If you are doing this as a homework
exercise, a
spreadsheet program can be an invaluable tool. Simply cut and paste the above
numbers
into the spreadsheet and ask it to sort them for you. This results in:
6.5, 8.7, 9.4, 9.8, 10.8, 11.3, 11.6, 12.1, 12.3, 12.6, 13, 13.1, 13.2, 13.4,
14.3, 14.6, 16.7, 17, 17.2, 18.3
Since there are 20 values in the data set, the median will be the average of
the 10
th
and
11
th
values. That is: (12.6+13)/2 = 12.8. According to the median, the fish are not
quite
long enough!
2.To compute the IQR we need Q
1
and Q
3
. Q
1
can be found by computing the median of
the first half of the data set. Those first ten numbers are:
6.5, 8.7, 9.4, 9.8, 10.8, 11.3, 11.6, 12.1, 12.3, 12.6.
The median of this data is (10.8+11.3)/2 = 11.05. We can find Q
3
in the same way, but
working with the top half of the data.
13, 13.1, 13.2, 13.4, 14.3, 14.6, 16.7, 17, 17.2, 18.3.
The median of the top half of the data is (14.3+14.6)/2 = 14.5. Therefore, the
IQR is
14.5-11.05 = 3.45. This means that the middle half of the fish fall into a
range of 3.45
inches.
The quartiles we have just seen are measures of relative standing. A measure of
relative standing
gives the position of a certain value in the data set. When we say that the
first quartile is 11.05, we
are saying that the value 11.05 (even though it is not in the data set above)
divides the bottom
quarter of the data from the top three-quarters of the data. Another related
measure of relative
standing is the percentile.
Percentile
The x
th
percentile is a value that divides the bottom x percent of the data from the
top 100-x
percent of the data in a given data set.
If you think about percentiles and quartiles, you may recognize that quartiles
are in fact specific
percentiles. The first quartile, Q
1
, is the 25th percentile. The median, Q
2
, is the 50th percentile. And
the third quartile, Q
3
, is the 75th percentile. Percentiles are seen most often in conjunction with
standardized measurements, such as an infants weight, or standardized test
results.
Example 1.3.9
Interpret the following statements involving the word percentile.
a.When little Johnny was born, his height was only in the 20th percentile. But
as he grew,
he was soon taller than all of his peers.
b.Sally really enjoys reading. She scored in the 95th percentile for reading on
her most
recent achievement test.
Solution
a.Johnny's height was in the 20th percentile, meaning that he was as tall or
taller than 20%
of newborns, and as tall or shorter than 80%. So relative to other newborns, he
was fairly
short.
b.Sally scored in the 95th percentile, meaning that her score was as good or
better than
95% of children who took this achievement test. Stated from the opposite
perspective,
only 5% of children scored as well or better than Sally.

Five Number Summaries and Box-Plots
The median and quartiles that we just saw can be used to create a graphic that
represents the
distribution (shape) of the data set. This graphic is referred to as a box-
plot. Before we see how to
build a box plot, however, let's look at the numbers that go into making the
plot.
Five Number Summary
The five number summary for a set of data is the minimum, first quartile,
median, third quartile,
and maximum for that set of data, once any outliers have been removed.
You have hopefully noticed that the five numbers that make up this summary are
the five quartiles,
Q
0
, Q
1
, Q
2
, Q
3
, and Q
4
that we saw on the last page, assuming that there are no outliers in the data
set. We will define how to identify outliers in the context of a five number
summary in the following
step-by-step definition of a box-plot.
Box-Plot
A box-plot, also called a box-and-whisker plot, is the graphical representation
of the five number
summary for a set of data. To construct a box-plot, follow these steps.
1.Draw a horizontal axis with a scale covering the entire range of values in
the data set.
2.Above that axis, draw a box with left side at the first quartile, and right
side at the third
quartile.
3.Draw a vertical line inside the box, dividing it at the median.
4.Sketch in temporary "fences" at 1.5 x IQR above and below the edges of the
box.
5.Mark any values from the data set that lie outside these fences with an
asterisk (*) on the
graph. They are outliers.
6.Draw horizontal lines extending from the left edge of the box down to the
minimum value
in the data set that is not an outlier, and from the right edge of the box to
the maximum
value that is not an outlier.
Unlike a histogram, the box-plot focuses on showing the range of data. This
range, excluding
outliers, is divided up into quarters allowing one to see where the data is
most "tightly packed"
together. Let's see how this works in an example.
Example 1.3.10
Construct a five-number summary and a box-plot for the data: { 14, 17, 10, 9,
16, 19, 12, 10, 15,
13 }
Solution
The first step is to compute the five number summary. To do that, we must
arrange the data in
order.
9 10 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 19
<
Q1
M Q3
>
We have marked the minimum with a <, first quartile with Q1, median with M,
third quartile with
Q3, and maximum with >. This gives us the five number summary 9, 10, 13.5, 16,
19. Now for
the box-plot.
Note that the temporary fences would have been at 10 - 1.5 x 6 = 1 and 16 + 1.5
x 6 = 25, which
are not within the range of the data, so we did not have any outliers in this
set of data.

Mean and Standard Deviation
While the median is a good measure of center to use in the case where we know a
set of data
contains outliers, it does have one major disadvantage. Namely, it does not
take the value of every
data point into consideration. In many instances, we want each value in the
data set to have weight
in determining the "typical" value. To achieve this goal, we turn back to an
already familiar
measure of center, typically called the average.
Mean
The arithmetic mean, which we will call simply the mean, is a measure of center
found by taking
the sum of all values in the data set and dividing by the number of values in
the data set.
Symbolically,
Population: \(\mu = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}\)
Sample: \(\overline{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}\)
Where the \( x_i \) represent the values in the data set, n the number of
values in the data set,
and the Greek letter \( \sum \) stands for summation.
Notice that there is a different symbol used for the mean depending on whether
it is the mean of an
entire population, or just the mean of a sample. For a population, the Greek
letter \( \mu \),
(pronounced "mu") is used for the mean. For a sample, we use \( \overline{x} \)
(read "x bar") to
represent the mean. Keep this distinction in mind, as it can be a clue as to
what type of data you
are dealing with in a homework or exam problem.
Another thing to note is that the name "arithmetic mean" is important. First,
we don't call this the
average, even though most people think of it as the average. The reason is
simply that the word
average means "typical," and we have seen several ways to measure the "typical"
value in a data
set. Next, while we will call it the mean, the arithmetic mean is really only
one type of mean. We
could also look at the geometric mean which is given by the formula:
\(\sqrt[n]{x_1 \times x_2 \times \cdots \times x_n}\)
For many data sets the geometric mean and arithmetic mean are very close. But
you wouldn't want
to have your homework average computed using the geometric mean. To understand
why not,
think about what would happen if only one of your assignments was not turned
in!
The measure of variation most commonly used with the mean is called the
variance. This can be
thought of as the average distance that each data point lies away from the
mean. If we compute
the average, however, we would get zero because of the +/- signs. So we square
these
differences, resulting in the following definition.
Variance
The variance measures the average square of the distance of a value from the
mean in a set of
data. Symbolically,
Population: \(\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}\)
Sample: \(s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i -
\overline{x})^2}{n-1}\)
Again we use a different symbol to represent the variance of a population--the
Greek letter \(
\sigma \) (sigma) squared--and a sample--the Latin letter s squared. But the
variance of a
population also differs in a more substantial way from that of a sample. Notice
that in a population,
we divide the sum of the differences squared by n, the number of values in the
population. But in a
sample, we divide by n-1. This is an important distinction to remember. The
reason for it is,
unfortunately, beyond the scope of the course, but has something to do with the
fact that in a
sample there is less variation than in the entire population.
One problem with using the variance as a measure of variation is that the units
are different from
the units of the data set. For example, if we say that the mean number of
children in a US
household is 2.2 with a variance of 0.4, then the mean has units "children"--
there are an average of
2.2 children in US households. The variance, however, has units "square
children". What does it
mean to say that the number of children varies by 0.4 square children? To
remedy that, the actual
measure of variation that we use with the mean is slightly different.
Standard Deviation
The standard deviation of a set of data is the square root of the variance.
Symbolically,
Population: \(\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}\)
Sample: \(s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i -
\overline{x})^2}{n-1}}\)
Let's test out these new formulas on an example.
Example 1.3.11
Find the mean and standard deviation of sample data {4, 6, 3, 8, 4}.
Solution
We will do this in three steps. First, the mean:
\(\overline{x} = \frac{4 + 6 + 3 + 8 + 4}{5} = \frac{25}{5} = 5.\)
Next, the variance. Using a table can make this computation easier.
\( x_i \)
\( (x_i - \overline{x}) \)
\( (x_i - \overline{x})^2 \)

4 - 5 = -1

4 - 5 = -1
(-1)

= 1
\( s^2 = \)
Finally, the standard deviation is \( s = \sqrt{4} = 2 \).
The number for this example turned out very nice. This is not always the case.
Usually the
standard deviation will involve decimals. In general, you should not round your
answers during any
intermediate steps, and then round your standard deviation to one decimal more
than the number
of decimals in the original data set. One quick way to estimate the standard
deviation is based on
the range of the data.
Estimating Standard Deviation
To estimate the standard deviation of a population, use
\(\sigma \approx \frac{\text{range}}{4}\)
In the above example, our estimate of (8-3)/4 = 1.25 is not terribly good, but
this can be a quick
and easy way to approximate the standard deviation. Try watching the following
video examples
for more practice finding means and standard deviations.

z-Scores and the Emperical Rule
With the mean and standard deviation now defined, we can look at how those can
be applied to
describing and comparing data sets. A "standard" deviation can be thought of as
a measure of
typical distance from the mean. In a typical data set, most data is within
three standard deviations
of the mean.
Example 1.3.12
Determine which of the in values in the sample { 4, 10, 12, 13, 9, 10 }, if
any, should be
considered an outlier.
Soultion
1.We could use the IQR to determine if a value is an outlier. In this method,
we will find the
first and third quartiles and then take anything that is more than 1.5 x IQR
away from
these values to be an outlier. Arranging the data in order: 4, 9, 10, 10, 12,
13, the
quartiles are Q
1
: 9 and Q
3
: 12. So the IQR is 12-9 = 3 and 1.5 x 3 = 4.5. This gives an
upper limit of 12+4.5 =16.5, so there are no outliers on the high side. The
lower limit is
9-4.5 = 4.5, so 4 is an outlier on the low side.
2.Using the mean and standard deviation gives us another way to check for
outliers.
The mean is:
\(\overline{x} = \frac{58}{6} \approx 9.7\)
The standard deviation is:
\(s = \sqrt{\frac{(4-9.7)^2 + (10-9.7)^2 + (12-9.7)^2 + (13-9.7)^2 + (9-9.7)^2
+
(10-9.7)^2}{5}} \approx 3.1\)
So outliers will be bigger than
\(\overline{x} + 3s = 9.7 + 3\times 3.1 = 19\)
and smaller than
\(\overline{x} - 3s = 9.7 - 3\times 3.1 = 0.4.\)
Thus, there are no outliers using this model.
This idea of measuring how unusual a value is by looking at the number of
standard deviations it
lies away from the mean is an important one for us to understand. We will use
this concept many
times in the weeks to come. There is a special name for this value which we
state next.
z-Score
The z-score of a value is the number of standard deviations that it lies away
from the mean. To
compute the z-Score of a value x, use one of the following formulas:
Population: \(z = \frac{x -
\mu}{\sigma}\)
Sample: \(z = \frac{x-\overline{x}}{s}\)
Note that in both cases the z-score is computed by subtracting the mean from
the value x and
dividing by the standard deviation.
Refining our second method in example 1.3.12, we can check individual values to
determine their
distance away from the mean, in terms of number of standard deviations, by
computing their z-
scores.
Example 1.3.13
In the last example, we saw that 4 was a potential outlier (according to the
IQR) in the data set
with mean \( \overline{x} = 9.7 \) and standard deviation \( s = 3.1 \). Find
and interpret the z-
score for 4.
Solution
The z-score for 4 is:
\(z = \frac{4 - 9.7}{3.1} \approx -1.83\)
This means that 4 lies 1.83 standard deviations below the mean. Since it is not
at least three
standard deviations above or below the mean, we do not consider it an outlier.
Another useful application of z-scores is to compare values from two different
data sets. A z-score
gives us a measure of relative standing. That is, how far above or below the
mean is this value
compared to the rest of the data in that data set.
Example 1.3.14
Using z-scores, determine which is better. A score of 70% on an exam with an
average score of
65% and a standard deviation of 2.5%, or a score of 70% on an exam with an
average score of
65% and a standard deviation of 15%.
Solution
The first exam score of 70%, or 0.70, has a z-score of \(z = \frac{0.70 - 0.65}
{0.025} = 2.0\).
The second exam score of 70%, or 0.70, has a z-score of \( z = \frac{0.70-0.65}
{0.15} \approx
0.333\).
So the score on the first exam is "higher" than the score on the second exam.
Even though both
scores are exactly the same value, 70%, a 70% on the first exam is actually a
better score
than a 70% on the second exam. This is because the first exam has a smaller
standard
deviation, meaning that the scores are more tightly grouped around the mean of
65%.
In the special case where we know that our data has a mound-shaped
distribution, meaning that if
we made a histogram it would be mound shaped with a mode right in the center
and symmetric
sides, we can use the z-scores to predict how much of the data will fall into
certain ranges.
Empirical Rule
The empirical rule states that in a mound-shaped distribution,
68% of the values will lie within one standard deviation of the mean (z-score
between -1
and 1),
95% of the values will lie within two standard deviations of the mean (z-score
between -2
and 2), and
99.7% of the values will lie within three standard deviations of the mean (z-
score
between -3 and 3).
You can see then why a z-score of less than -3 or more than 3 would make a
value an outlier. Only
0.3% of values should be in this range. To help you visualize the empirical
rule, take a look at the
following picture.
Now let's apply the empirical rule to an example.
Example 1.3.15
Suppose that the distribution of scores on a standardized exam is mound-shaped
with a mean of
\( \mu = 102.5 \) and standard deviation of \( \sigma = 9.8 \). Answer the
following questions.
a.What percent of the students scored between 82.9 and 122.1?
b.Between what two scores did 68% of students score?
c.The top 0.15% of students made at least what score?
Solution
1.Based on the empirical rule, since 82.9 = 102.5 - 2(9.8) and 122.1 = 102.5+2
(9.8), this is
the range that corresponds to 95% of the students.
2.According to the empirical rule, 68% of students scored within one standard
deviation of
the mean. So this range is from 102.5 - 9.8 = 92.7 and 102.5 + 9.8 = 112.3.
3.Finally, The top 0.15%, which is half of 0.3%, scored at least 3 standard
deviations above
the mean. So their score is at least 102.5 + 3(9.8) = 131.9.

Selecting Appropriate Summaries
We have now seen four different sets of numerical summaries.
The mode, which measures the center
The midrange and range, which measure center and variation
The median and IQR, which measure center and variation
The mean and standard deviation, which measure center and variation.
How do we know when to use a particular measure of center? To better answer
this question, let's
review the strengths and weaknesses of each of these numerical summaries in
tabular format.

As we can see, each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here is a
summary of when
each method is appropriate.
Mode
Use the mode when dealing with qualitative data, or for a quick measure of
center for small
sets of quantitative data. The mode may not exist, and should not be used in
general for
larger sets of quantitative data.
Midrange and Range
The midrange and range may be used for a quick estimate of center and
variation, but
should not be used if there are any indications of outliers.
Median and Inter-Quartile Range
Use the median and inter-quartile range if there are indications of strong
outliers in your
data. Data sets which with strong outliers would include income or housing
price data.
Mean and Standard Deviation
The mean and standard deviation are the best all-purpose measures of center and
variation for quantitative data. Unless your data set has strong outliers,
these are the
summary values you should use.
Example 1.3.16
Determine which measure of center would be best in each of the following data
sets.
a.The salaries of all employee's at IBM.
b.A quick assessment of how well a group of athletes did in a 100-meter dash.
c.Determine the typical hair color in a group of teenagers.
d.Finding the typical height of a pine tree in a given acre of forest.
Solution
a.Salaries of all employees at a large firm such as IBM are likely to include
outliers, such
as the CEO's salary. For this reason, the median is probably the best measure
of center.
b.The midrange may be best. This set of data should not include many outliers,
and the
values will be small and relatively close together. This makes the midrange an
acceptable way to quickly measure the center.
c.Hair color is a qualitative variable, so our only choice is to use the mode.
d.Pine tree heights on an acre of forest land should not have large outliers,
and there are
likely to be quite a few trees. Since there is no reason to use any of the
other measures
of center, the mean would be best here.
Often it is helpful to compute several summaries. One useful comparison relates
the mean and
median together. When the mean is larger than the median, the data will have a
histogram that is
skewed right. When the mean is smaller, the histogram will be skewed left.
Finally, if the mean and
median are equal, the histogram will be exactly symmetric.

Chebyshev's Inequality
While the empirical rule gives us a good way to estimate how much of a data set
will lie within one,
two, or three standard deviations of the mean, it does have limitations. First,
it only works if we
know the distribution is mound-shaped. If the distribution is skewed, bimodal,
or otherwise not
mound shaped the empirical rule will not give us accurate results. The other
drawback is that this
rule only tells us how much of the data is within the three ranges given: one,
two, or three standard
deviations on each side of the mean. The next rule we will examine is much more
general.
Chebyshev's Inequality
Chebyshev's Inequality states that the proportion of values in any distribution
that lie within k
standard deviations of the mean is at least \( 1-1/k^2\). Symbolically, if P is
the proportion of
values in the range from \( \mu - k\sigma\) to \(\mu+k\sigma\), then \(P \geq
1-\frac{1}{k^2}\).
Now let's revisit example 1.3.15 and see how this new rule can be applied.
Example 1.3.15 revisited
Suppose that the mean score on a standardized exam is \(\mu = 102.5\) and
standard deviation
is \(\sigma = 9.8\). Without assuming that the distribution of scores is mound
shaped, answer the
following questions.
a.What percent of the students scored between 82.9 and 122.1?
b.What percent of students will score between 87.8 and 117.2?
Solution
1.We can no longer use the empirical rule, since we do not know if the
distribution is
mound shaped. Instead, we use Chebyshev's Inequality. As before, we see that
102.5-82.9 = 19.6 = 2 x 9.8 and also 122.1 - 102.5 = 19.6 = 2 x 9.8. So the
range is two
standard deviations on either side of the mean. This means that k = 2 in
Chebyshev's
Inequality, and therefore the percent of values in this range is at least 1-1/2
2
= 3/4 or
75%.
Note that this is less than the 95% the empirical rule gave us. That is because
we can not
be as certain how the data is distributed if we don't know the shape of the
distribution.
2.For part 2, we again start by stating the range in terms of standard
deviations from the
mean. 102.5 - 87.8 = 14.7 and 14.7/9.8 = 1.5,. Also, 117.2-102.5 = 14.7 and
again
14.7/9.8 = 1.5. So our range is 1.5 standard deviations on either side of the
mean, and k
= 1.5 in Chebyshev's Inequality. Plugging this in we get at least 1-1/(1.5)
2
= 55.56% of
the data is within 1.5 standard deviations of the mean.
Note that this problem would not be possible with the empirical rule, even if
we knew the
distribution was mound shaped. 1.5 standard deviations is not one of the three
options
given by the empirical rule.
