Relationships Between Events
Consider the following problem, which appeared in Parade magazines Ask Marilyn
column.
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors:
Behind one
door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the
host, who
knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.
He then
says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to
switch your
choice? (Whitaker 1990)
What would you do? Think carefully and make up your mind before watching the
explanation video
below.
Monty Hall Problem
If you guessed wrong, don't feel bad. After the problem was published with a
solution similar to that
shown in the video, approximately 10,000 readers, including many with Ph.D.'s
wrote into the
magazine claiming that the solution is wrong.
In this section, we will study how knowing extra information can change
probabilities. This means
that we will first need to understand how the probability of one event can
depend on another event
happening or not happening. Click the continue button to get started!

Upon completion of this lesson, you should be able to describe the following
terms:
Bayes' Theorem, conditional probability, conditional probability formula,
general multiplication rule,

Upon completion of this lesson, you should be able to:
describe what it means for events to be independent.
identify pairs of events which are independent or mutually exclusive.
compute conditional probabilities.
use the general multiplication rule for probabilities.
use tree diagrams to organize events and compute their probabilities.
use Bayes' Theorem to find conditional probabilities from a tree diagram.
Note: This lesson has 5 checkpoints.
Independence
As the Monty Hall problem shows, sometimes knowing something about one event
can change the
probability of another event. Let's restate the Monty Hall problem solution in
a different way.
Example 2.4.1
In the context of the Monty Hall problem, define the following events:
A: the car is behind door number one
B: the car is behind door number two
C: the car is behind door number three
Suppose you pick door number three, and the game show host reveals that behind
door number
two there is a goat. Restate the conclusion to the Monty Hall problem in terms
of these events.
Solution
When you choose door three, you are hoping that P(C) = 1. That is, you are
hoping that even C
definitely happens.
When the game show host reveals the goat behind door number two, he tells you
that event B
definitely did not happen. This changes the probability of event C, and as we
saw in the video,
you should switch to door number one.
When knowledge about one event happening or not happening changes the
probability of another
event happening, the events are called dependent. When knowledge about one
event makes no
difference in the probability of another event happening, the events are called
independent.
Independent
Two events, A and B, are called independent if the occurrence of A has no
influence on the
probability of B.
To better understand the idea of independence, let's take a look at a few
examples.
Example 2.4.2
Determine if the pairs of events A and B described below are independent or
dependent.
a.A coin is flipped three times and A = "the first flip is a heads" while B =
"the last flip is a
heads."
b.A coin is flipped three times and A = "the first flip is a heads" while B =
"all flips are
heads."
c.An urn contains three marbles: 2 red and 1 white. Two marbles are drawn, with
replacement. A = "the first marble is white" while B = "the second marble is
white."
d.An urn contains three marbles: 2 red and 1 white. Two marbles are drawn,
without
replacement. A = "the first marble is white" while B = "the second marble is
white."
Solution
a.Does knowing if the first flip was a heads or tails change the probability
that the third flip
will be a heads? Coins do not have memories. Anything we know about the first
flip has
no effect on what happens on the second flip, so A and B are independent.
b.This experiment is different. Knowing that the first flip came up a heads
does have an
effect on whether all three flips come up heads. To see this more clearly, note
that if A
did not happen, then B can not happen. Therefore, A and B are dependent.
c.Since we are replacing the marbles after we draw them, the probability of
getting a red on
the first draw and on the second draw are the same: 2/3. What happens on the
first draw
does not effect the probability of getting a red on the second draw. Because of
this, A
and B are independent.
d.In our final question, we are again drawing marbles, but this time what
happens on the
first draw does make a difference. Since we do not replace the marbles we draw,
if A
does not happen (we draw red), there are two marbles left: 1 red and 1 white.
So P(B) =
1/2. However, if A does happen (we draw a white), then there are two marbles
left, both
of which are red. So P(B) = 0. Since P(B) changes depending on whether A
happens or
not, A and B are dependent.
As we shall see moving forward in this lesson, independent and dependent events
play an
important role in understanding more complex, multi-step probability
experiments. This concept
also becomes important later in the course when we are taking "independent
random samples"
and comparing them. For more examples of independent vs. dependent events, see

Conditional Probability
As we saw on the last page, the probability of one event can change depending
on the occurrence
of another. Because these probabilities can be different, we need a way to
denote the probability of
one event given than another has occurred. This is called the conditional
probability of the first
event, given that the second event happens. The formal definition is given
below.
Conditional Probability
The conditional probability of \( A\) given \(B\) is the probability of event \
(A\) given that
event \(B\) has occurred. Symbolically, this is written as \(P(A|B)\).
Many times we read \(P(A|B)\) as "the probability of A given B." This simply
means the probability
of A with the extra information that B has happened. In example 2.3.2, we saw
several pairs of
events where having that extra information changed the probability of A. These
dependent events
provide good examples for computing conditional probabilities.
Example 2.4.3
A coin is flipped three times. Events A and B are defined as follows.
A: the first flip is a heads
B: all three flips are heads
Find the sample space for this experiment, the outcomes in A, and the outcomes
in B. Use this
information to find P(A) and P(A|B).
Solution
Since the experiment involves flipping a coin three times, the outcomes will
have the form HHT,
for example, if the first flip were a heads, the second a heads, and the last a
tails. The set of all
outcomes is therefore:
\( S = \{ HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT \}. \)
The first event of interest, A, consists of all of the outcomes above resulting
in a heads on the
first flip. This is:
\( A = \{ HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT \}. \)
We can therefore conclude that \(P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac
{1}{2}\) or 0.50. But
what about B? The event B is:
\( B = \{ HHH \}.\)
If we know that \(B\) has happened, then we automatically know that \(A\) has
happened as well.
Because all three flips were heads, the first one must have been a heads.
Therefore, \( P(A|B) =
1. \) Note that \( P(A|B)\) and \(P(A)\) are different! This is equivalent to
saying that \(A\) and \(B\)
are dependent.
One good tool for visualizing conditional probability is a Venn Diagram. In the
two Venn Diagrams
below, we see how the "extra" information that B has happened changes the
probability of A by, in
a sense, redefining the sample space.
To compute P(A), we ignore B and take the ratio of the yellow area in A, to the
area of the whole
box. This is equivalent to saying that
\(P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}\)
When computing P(A|B), we know that event B has happened, so we are in the
purple area above.
To figure out how likely A is, we must take the ratio of the area in common to
both A and B to all of
B. This is equivalent to saying that
\(P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\)
Conditional Probability Formula
If A and B are events in a sample space S, then the conditional probability of
A given B is:
\(P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.\)
It is a good idea to have several different ways to think of a difficult
concept such as conditional
probability. Let's take a look at another example in which we use a contingency
table to represent
two different events and then to compute conditional probabilities.
Example 2.4.4
A hospital conducts a research study on 138 patients who have a history of
serious headaches.
Several of the patients are given an experimental headache drug, while others
are given ordinary
Tylenol. Patients are then checked after 15 minutes to see if they are still
suffering from
headaches.
Suppose one of these people is randomly selected. Use the given table to answer
the following
questions.
1. Find P(H. Gone), the probability the
person's headache is gone.
2. Find P(H. Gone| Tylenol), the probability
the person's headache is gone given
that they took Tylenol.
3. Are the events "H. Gone" and "Tylenol"
independent? Explain.
Experimental Drug
TylenolHeadache Persists
12
40
Headache Gone
53
33
Solution
Our first step is to find the marginal distributions for this contingency
table. With those added, the
table becomes:
Experimental Drug
Tylenol
Total
Headache Persists
12
40
52
Headache Gone
53
33
86
Total
65
73
138
1.P(H. Gone) = 86/138 = 0.6232 since 86 of the 138 peoples' headaches were gone
after
15 minutes.
2.To find P(H. Gone | Tylenol), we use the conditional probability formula.
\(P(\text{H. Gone}|\text{Tylenol}) = \frac{P(\text{H.
Gone}\cap\text{Tylenol})}{P(\text{Tylenol})} = \frac{\frac{33}{138}}{\frac{73}
{138}} =
\frac{33}{73} = 0.4521\)
3.Since the probability of the headache being gone changed when we were told
the person
took Tylenol, these two events are not independent--they are dependent.
Note: When we have a contingency table, there is a short-cut to finding
conditional probability.
Since we are told in (b) that the person took Tylenol, we restrict ourselves to
the Tylenol column.
Then, the probability that their headache is gone is simply 33/73 = 0.4521, as
above.
In the following video examples, we will see more instances in which we are
asked to compute
conditional probabilities.

General Multiplication Rule
In lesson 2.3, we saw a rule for finding \(P(A\cup B)\), which we called the
general addition rule.
We have not, however, seen a method for finding \(P(A\cap B)\), the probability
that both A and B
occur. A little bit of algebra with the conditional probability formula
produces just such a rule.
General Multiplication Rule
If A and B are events in a sample space S, then
\(P(A\cap B) = P(B)P(A|B)\text{ and } P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B|A).\)
This is called the general multiplication rule because it works in general--for
any A and B.
Example 2.4.5
An urn contains 10 marbles: 7 red and 3 white. Two marbles are drawn randomly,
one after the
other, without replacement. Find the probabilities that:
a.The second marble is red given that the first marble was red.
b.The first and second marbles are both red.
Solution
a.Since we are told that the first marble was red, when drawing the second
marble we have
9 marbles remaining, 6 of which are red. So, the probability the second marble
is red is
6/9 = 2/3.
b.The probability that the first marble is red will be 7/10 since seven of the
10 marbles are
red. In (a), we saw that the probability the second marble is red given that
the first was
red is 2/3. Using the general multiplication rule, the probability that the
first and second
marbles are red is \(7/10 \times 2/3 = 14/30 = \) 7/15.
In the special case where A and B are independent, the conditional probability
for B given A is the
same as the probability for B. That is, P(B|A) = P(B). The general
multiplication rule then becomes:
\(P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B).\)
This is in fact one of the best ways to test two events and see if they are
independent.
Test of Independence
Events A and B in a sample space S are independent if and only if \(P(A\cap B)
= P(A) P(B).\)
Let's try this new test for independence out on an a few examples.
Example 2.4.6
Two events \(A\) and \(B\) in a sample space \(S\) have probabilities \(P(A) =
0.36\) and \(P(B) =
0.25\). The probability of their union is 0.52. Are \(A\) and \(B\)
independent?
Solution
We first use the general addition rule to find \(P(A\cap B)\).
\( \begin{aligned} P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B) &\Rightarrow 0.52 =
0.36 + 0.25 -
P(A\cap B) \\ &\Rightarrow P(A\cap B) = 0.09. \end{aligned}\)
Next, we check using our test of independence.
\(P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B) \Leftrightarrow 0.09 = 0.36 \times 0.25.\)
Since the above equation is true, A and B are in fact independent events.
Example 2.4.7
A coin is weighted so that the probability of a heads is 1/3 while the
probability of a tails is 2/3.
This coin is flipped four times. Find the probability that:
1.all four flips are tails.
2.three of the four flips are tails.
Solution
Because flipping a coin multiple times gives independent events, (remember the
coin has no
memory, so one flip can not affect another), we can use the multiplication rule
to get:
\( \begin{aligned} P(\text{1st T}\cap\text{2nd T}\cap\text{3rd T}\cap\text{4th
T}) &= P(\text{1st
T})P(\text{2nd T})P(\text{3rd T})P(\text{4th T}) \\ &=
\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{3} \\ &= \frac{16}
{81} \\ &\approx 0.1975.
\end{aligned}\)
For the second part, notice that the process works in much the same way, but
one of the four
flips must be a H instead of a T. So, adding together all the ways this could
happen, we get:
\(\left(\frac{1}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}\right) +
\left(\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{1}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}\right) +
\left(\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{1}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}\right) +
\left(\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{1}{3}\right) =
\frac{32}{81} \approx
0.3951.\)
More problems involving the general multiplication rule and the test for
independence can be seen
in the following video examples.

Tree Diagrams and Probability
A tree diagram has been useful in the past when working with multi-stage
experiments. Since the
multiplication rule naturally fits experiments that can be broken up into
stages (first A happens,
then B, etc) it makes sense to look into using a tree diagram again. Consider
the following
example.
Example 2.4.8
An urn contains six marbles: 3 blue marbles, 2 red marbles, and 1 white marble.
Two marbles
are drawn, one after the other, without replacement and their colors are noted.
Draw a tree
diagram and label the branches with appropriate probabilities for this
experiment. Use the tree
diagram to find P(2nd W|1st R) and P(2nd W)
Solution
In the tree diagram to the right, the labels
represent the color of marble drawn. The
fractions on the branches represent the
probability of drawing that color marble at that
stage in the experiment. Note from the tree:
P(2nd W| 1st R) can be read right off the
tree. Since we are given that the first
marble was red, we go across that
middle R branch. Now, the probability
the 2nd is W is the probability on the W
branch, so 1/5.
There are two ways the 2nd marble can
be white. If the 1st is red and if the 1st is
blue. These are distinct (mutually
exclusive) paths through the tree. The
probability of 1st R and 2nd W can be
found by multiplying probabilities 2/6 and
1/5 to get 2/30. The probability of 1st B
and 2nd W can be found by multiplying
3/6 and 1/5 to get 3/30. Adding these
two together gives 2/30 + 3/30 = 5/30 =
1/6.
Note that the probabilities on the branches of such a tree diagram are
conditional probabilities. In
the example above, the 2/5 on the bottom branch from W to R is actually P(2nd
R|1st W) because
it connects the event 1st W the event 2nd R. The general multiplication rule is
then used to find the
probability of any path through the tree.
Probability both red: 2/6 x 1/5 = 2/30
Probability the first is red and the second blue: 2/6 x 3/5 = 6/30
Etc...
Finally, as in the second question in our example, we can find the probability
of events such as
"the second is red" by adding together all the different probabilities for
paths in which the second
marble is red.
Since tree diagrams lend themselves better to video examples, we will forgo
another example in
the lesson, and instead provide a third video example for using tree diagrams
with conditional
probability.

Bayesian Probability
Tree diagrams can be very useful for dealing with conditional probabilities, as
long as the
conditions are in the correct order. In a multi-stage experiment, the tree
diagram does a good job
of showing the probability of a particular outcome on the second step, given
that a certain outcome
on the first step occurred. What if, however, we want to look at things in the
other order? Consider
the following example.
Example 2.4.9
Recall that the tree diagram below gives us the probabilities for an experiment
in which two
marbles are drawn, without replacement, from an urn containing 3 blue marbles,
2 red marbles,
and 1 white marble. Use the tree to help find the probability that the 1st
marble was white given
that the second is red.
Solution
We wish to find P(1st W | 2nd R). Unfortunately,
our tree diagram is "backwards" for this
computation. The probabilities on the branches
are the probability of a particular color on the
2nd marble given that we got a certain color on
the first. So, we must resort to the conditional
probability formula.
\(P(\text{1st W}|\text{2nd R}) = \frac{P(\text{1st
W}\cap\text{2nd R})}{P(\text{2nd R})}.\)
The numerator of this fraction can be found by
multiplying along a single branch in the
tree--\(1/6 \times 2/5 = 2/30\). To get the
denominator, we need to add together the
probabilities for all possible ways the last marble
can be red. This is:
\(P(\text{2nd R}) =
\left(\frac{3}{6}\times\frac{2}{5}\right) +
\left(\frac{2}{6}\times\frac{1}{5}\right) +
\left(\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{2}{5}\right) =
\frac{1}{3}.\)
Therefore, the desired conditional probability is:
\(P(\text{1st W}|\text{2nd R}) = \frac{2/30}{1/3} =
\frac{1}{5} = 0.20.\)
These "backwards" conditional probability questions make use of a formula
created by a British
mathematician and Presbyterian minister, Thomas Bayes. Bayes' theorem, as it
was named after
his death, is given below.
Bayes' Theorem
If a sample space can be split into mutually exclusive events \(A_1, A_2,
\ldots, A_n \) and \(E\)
is an event in \(S\) with \(P(E) > 0\), then:
\(P(A_i|E) = \frac{P(A_i)P(E|A_i)}{P(A_1)P(E|A_1) + P(A_2)P(E|A_2) + \cdots +
P(A_n)P(E|A_n)}.\)
While this theorem formally states the rule we use to solve problems such as
the one above, it is
not something you should memorize. Instead, use a tree diagram and the
conditional probability
formula to solve these problems as we did in example 2.4.9, and as we will do
in the video
examples below.
